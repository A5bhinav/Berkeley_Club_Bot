"Over the past month on this subreddit there have been numerous posts about alienation from minority folk that I resonate with as one myself and I'd like to share my own experiences in regards to consulting club culture.

Why is there a legit vacuum of asian members in each of these 'exclusive' and 'prestigious' consulting clubs? Like seriously: look at the club photos on any of their site and it's very very monolithic. Take a look 3 club sites I thought of at the top of my head:

[https://www.voyagerconsulting.org/](https://www.voyagerconsulting.org/)

[https://dssberkeley.com/](https://dssberkeley.com/)

[https://pbl.berkeley.edu/leadership.html#executive](https://pbl.berkeley.edu/leadership.html#executive)

I think most people see through the bs of the image of meritocracy of the application process these clubs pretend to have. People know you're being judged by students who are 1-2 years older than you, and that 'vibes' are the main thing. The application process is akin to rushing a frat/sorority, but I'd like to wager within this realm of 'club vibes' is legit just discrimination based off color that even frats/sorority don't have. Look, I understand that a majority of rushees are white and thus it makes sense if greek life is majority white, but there still exists members of other races. Likewise, the majority of consulting club applicants are asian, but there's a very VERY noticable monolothic type of member that gets accepted.

I asked a couple of clubs during tabling about their DEI, and pointed out my observation of their inclusiveness. I've very literally been hit with: 'we see this as an issue' and 'it's because of inherit biases that people gravitate towards others who look like them'. Needless to say I felt estranged even after the info sessions where you have an opportunity to talk to the members. Out of the ten or so clubs I applied to I made it through two first rounds but didn't get accepted to any in the end.

Overall my takeaway is if you're a minority don't bother wasting your time and applying to these clubs.",Diversatech at Berkeley is the worst one
I am an incoming freshman at Haas next year and plan on joining a consulting club. I know a lot of these clubs have acceptance rates under 5% but what actually sets the 5% apart from the other 95%? Is it behavioral? Personality? Based on accomplishments? Grades even?,Bro there is asian monoculture at the school lol
Consulting clubs making us look bad smh,"Interesting take and valid points, but i think the primary cause of the race monolith is that they love to let in their friends; and those friends tend to be of the same racial background, due to family connections or other random reasons."
titles kinda self explanatory lol. didn’t even make it to the interview round despite having known half the board/directors for the year i was in it. need advice so this doesn’t feel so earth shattering and how to not take it personally lol. feeling at a loss also since this did give me hella opportunities that ill no longer have access to 🫠,for the pbl one they have basically a DEI statement on their website and from what I see not a single urm ( black or brown person) is in the club lol. these people don't practice what they preach . the hypocrisy.
"My friend and I were enjoying dinner in the social lounge of my apartment(Standard) when this girl walked up to us and told us that there was going to be a meeting for UFA(Undergrad Finance Association) in the lounge. She told us that we might want to move to a quieter area since it might get loud, but we told her that we were okay with a bit of noise.  

Five minutes later this angry Asian guy walks over to us and starts pressing us, snarling at us telling us that we need to leave immediately, saying we’ve been told multiple times to leave. I tell the guy to stop being so rude and he starts growling about how he reserved the room, even though you can’t reserve that lounge at the Standard. After he started yelling and cursing at us to leave, I told him to calm down and said that we were almost done eating, and we would leave soon.  

My friend was obviously pissed since he actually pays rent here and who tf was that clown coming in here and yelling at us to leave. This is the first time I’ve encountered this kind of toxicity here at Berkeley. Are Haas students generally that obnoxious and entitled?",sucks but it’s how it be sometimes - you can make the first step and create your own. but in the long run you’re not missing too much from extremely exclusive clubs
"My friends keep raving about how impossible it is to get into these consulting/prestigious clubs, even with their impressive resumes. I'm transferring in this spring and genuinely think I have a shot at it but I'm questioning if I'm in way over my head. As far as my experience goes, I have 5 months as a legal assistant at a Worker's comp law firm, a year working in Asset Protection (finance, estate planning, etc.), 2 years as a volunteer for big charity, and I was an English teacher in Lebanon over the summer. I basically have a strong background in law, finance, and NGO work.

I know career-wise I'm ahead of the average student, but I wonder if my experiences stack up well enough to be part of some ""Berkeley Elite"" clubs and organizations. I just don't know what to expect, and I wanna prep with these next 4 months the best I can.

Any advice?

EDIT:  
Gah dayum y'all making this a genetics issue","Let’s not forget they’re always from competitive Bay Area, Los Angeles, or Orange County high schools with majority Asian populations!"
"Hi! I am working with students from all around the world and we're setting up a low-pressure consulting organization specializing in marketing, operations, and strategy.

We already have several startups and small companies interested and we're looking to expand our team to help out with writing articles for our publication, market research, etc.

Let me know if you're interested :)","Just like in the real world: Without some kind of mandate (e.g. a DEI initiative or an affirmative action* requirement) people like to hire people that are just like them.  We used to refer to it as it “the old boys club.”  

*Affirmative action was banned in CA 30 years ago, not recently like many people believe."
fuck consulting clubs all they do is jerk each other off all day and waste everyone’s time. ,This school is very much Asian dominated to a point that you will get excluded from certain groups if you arent
First year freshman and I know my whole college career isn’t ruined and there are lots of opportunities to be explored. BUT i feel like I’ve put all my eggs into the consulting basket these past few weeks and it’s fallen through. I’ve missed a lot of other deadlines for clubs so what should I do next…..? Any advice? ,"I am sure there are minority students who don't even bother applying because of how homogeneous the clubs look. Also, all these clubs having a token white boy for diversity lol"
"Club culture is really intense and scary, especially for new students entering such a big campus like Cal. Clubs, specifically those in finance and consulting, get a bad reputation for being so selective and elitist. Some for very good reasons, and some for no reason at all. After speaking with many friends who became involved with finance organizations, professional fraternities, and strategy consulting clubs, we realized how much they transformed our experiences and professional outcomes. Although that was our personal experience, we realized that some were hesitant given polarized opinions, which this guide aims to clear up.

On a more personal note, club recruiting is extremely mystified in my opinion at Cal. It's summed up by the quote ""Those who know don't speak. Those who speak don't know"". When students get bombarded at tabling with tens of hundreds of club sales pitches, it is hard to separate fact from fiction (especially when all that is publicized are such extreme takes). In my opinion, there are very few out there that are willing to have authenticity with transfers or freshmen especially who come to Cal wide eyed, so I wanted to share insights I've gathered in hopes of helping those students.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Disclaimers (please read):

1. As many people argue, you definitely **do not need to join a student organization** to have a great experience at Cal. Some choose to focus on classes and their GPA, pursue academic research, pursue professional roles directly, or a combination of all of them. It is evident that some students inflate business-oriented clubs to be a necessity, but my friends and I know so many others who are not in professional clubs that still have great experiences at Cal and reach their professional goals. Affinity groups, religious organizations, greek life, and other niche interest groups are a great way to meet great friends, have a great time in college, and reach your professional goals. *You can create your own path here. Everyone else's path doesn't have to mold you.*
2. However, saying that these organizations **WON'T** make it easier for you to reach certain professional business goals (mainly within high finance/consulting) **is most likely inaccurate**. Some alumni in these clubs go back 20 years and have pursued every career in finance, investing, entrepreneurship, consulting, etc. There undoubtedly is **a higher concentration** of alumni who have attained **professional success**, which naturally makes it easier for members to replicate. Things like mentorship, compiled resources, and the preferential treatment from alumni can help in essentially any role (apart from any post-graduate schooling). It may or may not be true that ""you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with"", but it's likely the case that the people you spend the most time with have the *highest probability of affecting you the most*.
3. This list mainly gives **opinions** on prestige and placements, but it also aims to show a laundry list of possible options that might make it easier to learn about these clubs rather than going down rows of tents each semester. Clubs at the top may be more ""successful"", but that *does not mean in any regard that you can't find success in any of the other clubs*. Conversely, it also means that clubs at the top do not guarantee any degree of higher success.
4. Other lists go into approximate acceptance rates, but these guesses are unfounded and hard to standardize. Most clubs take 10-12 kids a semester, with most around 6-10, *which already is less than 10%* if 100 people apply, which is almost certain given Berkeley's population. Taking devil's advocate, **it is important for clubs on campus to stay relatively small**, as that is exactly why they make the experiences of their members and why they are tight-knit. At the end of the day, just know you can find this experience in *so many clubs*, that even if acceptance rates are low, **any one club can equally be great for you**. Lower acceptance rates may mean more prestige, but that does not mean higher acceptance rate clubs can't help you reach success.
5. The issue of racial demographics within clubs listed **may be out of the control of the clubs**. A vast majority of these clubs tend to have CS, DS, EECS, Math, Econ, and Business majors, as those majors tend to be interested in the work these clubs do. Not only is Berkeley's population *disproportionately* Asian, but those Asians even more *disproportionately* make up the majors above. Applicants that tend to be interested in these clubs thus tend to be extremely *disproportionately* Asian. The issue is greater than just members trying to pick their own, with many **clubs largely trying to make as diverse classes** as possible, but failing given the amount of Asians that are interested and qualified. What is unfortunate and wrong is that **many clubs refuse to take juniors or older students** given that they want to ""invest"" in members that can ""contribute"" for as long as possible, which is genuinely terrible and discriminatory. However, some organizations are more welcoming and I will try to highlight those that are below.
6. Finally, I will **only be mentioning business organizations**. It's really hard to draw parallels between business and finance oriented clubs to tech clubs who have different objectives and target different students, so for the purpose of standardization, clubs mentioned will have at least some strategy consulting arm, professional/business help objective, or investing objective.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Strategy Consulting Clubs (24):

**- Clubs that reach out to companies to give recommendations/insights for real life situations they are facing in exchange for donations, which are basically payments for the work. For reference, technology consulting usually refers to building software in exchange for donations.**

*Tier 1A:*

**Berkeley Business Society (BBS)**

Strong placements across consulting and tech especially. Used to make new members sign a pledge to not join other clubs as many would use BBS to join business fraternities, but as of recently has been a very tight knit group of people who are super social. Have done national and international trips with consulting revenue, and have recently had a lot of Greek life ties with current members. Has a pretty big culture of getting members to buy into the club, which may lead to some self-obsession with the club but also leads to one of the tightest cultures. Used to be nicknamed ""Brown Boys Society"".

**Voyager Consulting**

Newest club in this tier (founded in 2012, spun out of BBS), but has an unmatched reputation given their super easy resume drop application that plummets their[ acceptance rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/opinion/rejection-college-youth.html). Take on Fortune 500 clients, and have lots in tech and tech clubs (ML@B members specifically), but have probably the best  placements in quant and finance, though results can vary. Culture varies vastly given many technical members, but has good retention due to making all members come to recruitment.

**Berkeley Consulting (BC)**

Their pitch is always that they are the oldest consulting club, which explains their strong MBB placements. They make their members work a lot, but are able to land huge projects charging the most money of any club due to their reputation. Culture has fallen off vastly compared to Voyager and BBS, with the club prioritizing for members with extremely impressive resumes rather than social fit, which explains why they have insane elitism and not as strong placements for this tier.

*Tier 1B:*

**Net Impact at Berkeley (NIB)**

Clubs with ""Berkeley"" in the name are usually well established given that administration banned the word for student clubs a while back, and this rings true for NIB. Mainly social impact consulting but they generate solid revenue with members mainly pursuing tech roles (software and product management usually). The culture is really friendly with nice people that are genuine friends, which is honestly great. Premier social impact organization, and known for taking older students.

**CMG Strategy Consulting; formerly Creative Marketing Group**

Formerly used to be a marketing based club (as the name suggests), but pivoted to make money as most clubs do. A lot of overlap with business frats (UBG and BAP specifically), but has really great diversity and has landed bigger projects with name brand clients. Members end up pursuing finance more so than other consulting clubs, but still have many opting for traditional PM or strategy roles.

**The Berkeley Group (TBG)**

Pro bono consulting (which means the club generates no revenue), but the culture is really great given that members aren't joining to sell out to free perks and join for community. People are genuinely nice, and the culture feels pretty tight. Members tend to recruit alright, especially in consulting and have good MBB pipelines. Mostly nonprofit projects, so if you don't care about F500 names then this is a fit.

*Tier 1C:*

**ABA Consulting; formerly Asian Business Association**

Another club that used to not do consulting, but pivoted to make money. The club is very east Asian, but they have extremely wholesome members who engage in a pretty vast variety of consulting projects with big clients. They also host a ""business"" talent show with the other business organizations that is lighthearted and gives organizations a chance to compete for fun.

**Valley Consulting Group (VCG)**

Strategy consulting for tech companies. People end up pursuing tech or consulting within tech consequentially. They value diversity a lot and being inclusive as of recently, but they haven't collaborated with top tech companies and received payment for the past few semesters and have had a reputation for being really cliquey. Known for taking transfers and inclusion initiatives.

**Venture Strategy Solutions (VSS)**

Strategy consulting that they claim is only for startups and small businesses, but in reality is for anyone who is willing to pay. Lots of big tech placements given they are startup-focused. They have drama sometimes but people generally enjoy their experience. Known to be more east asian than other consulting clubs, but is recently improving diversity wise.

*Tier 2A:*

**180 Degrees Consulting**

One of the few clubs here that is currently sponsored by Haas (has to use the Haas application). The members recruit so-so, with mentorship and good placements not being that abundant, and many members opting to join after already joining another organization on campus for shallow reasons (prestige, resume padding). Nevertheless, they engage in solid projects and generate revenue even though they are technically supposed to be doing non-profit work. A social bunch overall.

**Diversatech (DT)**

DT does some technology projects along with strategy projects, but overall as the name suggests is supposed to be about upholding diversity of demographics and interests. Members mainly do go into tech and PM roles, but they have not prioritized diversity as much as they tout as of recently.

**Upsync Consulting**

Like DT, they also engage in tech consulting and have recently been growing and generating a lot of revenue through big tech projects specifically. They are known for being extremely South and East Asian, but all the members seem to enjoy the club and are welcoming of other people. They also are able to afford international trips once in a while.

**Phoenix Consulting/Health Engine**

One of the two clubs listed that focuses on healthcare consulting, which attracts pre-meds or students interested in medicine/healthcare broadly (i.e. biotech, healthcare finance/consulting). Really good vibes given that they usually aren't selling out to big clients and value learning in healthcare. Also has a startup arm, Health Engine, that started a few years ago but has produced some pretty impressive funding for its portfolio companies.

**Healthcare Consulting Group (HCG)**

The other club that focuses on healthcare, which explains a lot of similarities (people who mainly are interested in healthcare). Again, good vibes given most members are there to pursue their passion for healthcare and not to make money, but the club has really good success getting paid projects anyways and hosting decent socials.

*Tier 2B:*

**Next Gen Consulting (NGC)**

Broad strategy consulting for F500 companies. Have been sourcing paid projects consistently and go international for trips. Culture is variant, as they are very South Asian and cliquey, but recently have had more diverse members, many with sorority and fraternity ties. Recently has been placing really well among consulting and business development roles broadly, but has some members not placing at all.

**Entrepreneurs at Berkeley (E@B)**

Initially started as an incubator for startups and entrepreneurs but has also pivoted to pursuing more traditional projects with companies recently getting a few pretty cool paid ones. Social culture is decent and friendly given recent success, but has no emphasis necessarily on member placement, only basically on ensuring their startup arm runs well.

**Nova Consulting**

Strategy consulting group that is one of the younger ones on this list (founded in 2023), that does a variety of strategy and some tech projects. Hosts solid socials, with members recruiting well above the standards of a club with its youth across tech and consulting. Members are extremely south and east asian and may be cliquey, but overall has a chill vibe with solid retention.

**Business Careers in Entertainment Club (BCEC)**

One of the biggest clubs at Cal with a focus on entertainment companies. Appeals to students with media, film, or sports passions naturally, but has mixed success being paid even when working with big name clients. Although the club is huge because anyone can be a general member while a lot less are on projects, the size overall leads many to use the club as a launchpad to join other organizations on campus. Members are laid back about projects overall given their passion inherently for the work.

*Tier 3A:*

**Global Research and Consulting (GRC)**

Another chain of clubs across the country, with some smaller non profit projects and some super small paid projects. Really good vibe as commitment is lower and members are really nice and chill about the work they do, but also has mixed outcomes in high finance or tech given many members opt to pursue different careers. Also known to take older students which is a plus.

**Phi Beta Lambda (PBL)**

Structured almost like a professional fraternity that devotes its time to professionally developing its members while also doing consulting to generate revenue, but doesn't have a fraternal vibe socially. Majority place at name brand firms, but may not be doing core business functions at those firms. The community is super inclusive with some cliqueyness, with exits really mixed across finance and tech.

**Consult Your Community (CYC)**

National chain of clubs that is supposed to focus on small businesses (that are in the community), but projects as of recently have had more of a mix of paid and in connection with big name clients. Has really great low commitment consulting but also has really mixed recruiting outcomes overall, with some not placing. The club structure makes most not that tight knit but everyone is cordial.

*Tier 3B:*

**Delta Consulting**

Consulting initially focused on EdTech, but has fully pivoted recently to any companies that would generate revenue. Members tend to be very nice and also very South Asian, but are known to not be cliquey with members being generally lighthearted about the consulting work they do. They place decently within software roles, but don't have any consistent recruiting success given its youth.

**Bay Area Environmentally Aware Consulting Network (BEACN)**

Environmentally-conscious consulting, usually with startups and other nonprofits. Vibes are really great given most are passionate about the work being done and decent mentorship all around, which is great for more laid back startup oriented work. Professional exits are weak and scattered across industries.

**SBC Strategy Consulting**

Originally focused on seed-stage startups, but has shifted to work for large Fortune 500 clients. The active members are close, but most projects are unpaid and sourcing is inefficient, leading to really bad retention and a vast majority becoming inactive. Still, they’re known for being inclusive—often admitting older students or those who don’t fit the traditional consulting profile. Weak exits.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Business and Professional Fraternities (5):

**- Organizations solely dedicated to social and professional development of their members, specifically through a pledge process. For reference: some of these fraternities generate revenue through consulting like the ones above, but most focus on establishing the strongest pipelines on campus and ensuring their members place well.**

**- Note: I will not be giving any type of tiering from now on given the insufficient number of organizations within these categories.**

**Undergraduate Business Group (UBG); formerly Delta Sigma Pi (DSP) and Rho Consulting**

The most scrutinized club on this list by a mile, and for good reason. They undoubtedly have the most intense pledge process of probably any organization on campus, but they also have the best pipelines as well. The pledge process is the most grueling out of all of the business frats, with a lot of wet hazing and late nights (which explains why they got kicked off campus twice hence two name changes). Every single member basically opts to do investment banking (even if they don't like it which causes some to regret their decision later), but they are extremely good at placing well. They have direct pipelines to Goldman Sachs' TMT office in SF and an alumni network that is practically unparalleled. Their pledge process definitely leaves members traumatized and causes social culture to be extremely toxic, but also results in the members that choose to be involved, really active, and form their only social circles within the club. The club also scrutinizes members who choose to join other organizations on campus, which proves more toxicity and the inward social circles.

**Collegiate Business Association (CBA); formerly Alpha Kappa Psi (AKPsi)**

Similarly to UBG, CBA had a name change and is known for wet hazing their pledges extensively. However, although their placements are not as good as UBG's, they still are extremely elite with many going to top banks and firms across the country. Given that their process is not as grueling as UBG, many say the social culture is far better but still toxic given the members aren't as resentful to older members who used to haze them. Many members utilize help from older members to join other clubs like BIG, UFA, and BFC to get more learning and connections as well.

**Beta Alpha Psi (BAP)**

Almost entirely East Asian business fraternity, but recently have made the fraternity slightly more diverse. Similar to CBA, all their placements are extremely elite within finance across the country with the process not being as grueling as UBG's but still including a significant amount of physical and wet hazing like CBA. Also like CBA, specifically known to send members to other clubs like BIG, UFA, BFC, and CMG. Has a common toxic culture given resentment to older members for hazing.

**Pi Sigma Epsilon (PSE)**

Originally a marketing fraternity, they have since shifted into a more multi-disciplinary professional fraternity of sorts, sending members all over to strategy, consulting, finance, and PM roles. Their pledge process is not on any level near the big 3 business fraternities listed above (i.e. wet or with extreme tasks), but still is effort. Generates solid revenue from their consulting arm, ZC Consulting, allowing them to go on international trips every so often. Culture is definitely less toxic than the others, and is known to take juniors and junior transfers as well which is a good sign of inclusion.

**Alpha Epsilon Zeta (AEZ)**

All male professional fraternity like PSE with mostly south asians. Although the only fraternity on this list that only takes guys and isn't nationally based like the others listed, they do have a decent alumni network across a lot of disciplines at top banks and tech companies, with the same focus on placing well like other business fraternities and a process comparable to PSE's. Notably does consulting on the side like PSE and runs a really big startup event with venture capitalists in the area, but are a more mix of a social fraternity given ties to other south asian organizations and also given social parties and events that they host as well. Also takes juniors and transfers.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Investing and Finance Organizations (5):

**- Organizations that are the closest to affinity groups on this list, with the main goal of the clubs to teach its members about finance or investing.**

**Berkeley Investment Group (BIG)**

Probably the oldest non rebranded club on this list, founded in 1997. Student-run hedge fund that creates investment pitches in public equities with over $140k in assets (provided through alumni donations). Has a rigorous and extensive education process for first semester new members with return offers given depending on the quality of work, which results in members that are really knowledgeable but more socially absent. Has relationships with Point72 and Citadel and consistently sends members there along with other extremely prestigious banks and hedge funds mainly. Many members as of recently come from professional fraternities, but the interview process is still extremely meritocratic however given that the initial application is a fully anonymous stock pitch.

**Capital Investments at Berkeley (CIB)**

Student-run hedge fund founded more recently in 2013. Notably invests their over $100k through other strategies and not necessarily just pure public equities unlike BIG. Has a rigorous education process as well with return offers on the line for entrance into the club, and elite placements in finance across the board given the rigor of that education and similar relationships with Point72 and Citadel. More socially tight knit compared to BIG with their interview process prioritizing for fit and willingness to learn rather than pure investing ability, and has more internal and cross club social events. Notably has a Quant division with members educated in the technical side of investing that has a track record of producing many quant developers and software engineers.

**Undergraduate Finance Association | Undergraduate Management Consulting Group (UFA|UMCG)**

Connects members with club alumni to ensure placements, with those members becoming alumni and naturally giving back to the club that helped them. It has the largest laundry list of elite placements for a club across banks, hedge funds, private equity firms, and consulting firms (maybe tied with UBG). The engagement among members is limited given the focus on connecting with alumni, and the interview process (especially for older students) is extremely grueling as they want to test whether you will pass actual job interviews. Known to not take juniors and rarely ever take sophomores.

**Undergraduate Finance Club; formerly Berkeley Finance Club (BFC)**

Fraternal values in the sense of a pledge-esque process and emphasis on members recruiting well, but they are successful at that goal, with members helping each other during intense interview processes for finance roles and most members placing at great investment banks usually. The culture is more fraternal, but that also means that members are really tight knit and care to give back to younger members when they recruit for internships.

**Blackskies Investments**

Super new club; international founders gave $1.3 million to make it the highest AUM (assets under management) investment club at Cal. Initially made to invest in a lot of asset classes, they recently shifted to VC only and focusing on the founder and startup ecosystem. Given its youth, the club is really decentralized and does not have a record of having a robust education system that teaches its members or placing anywhere although some place at some mid-tier banks or venture capital firms.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Other Related Clubs (25):

\- There are so many other clubs that would take a whole dissertation to finish discussing, so I will give brief descriptions instead. These clubs may not have consulting, investing, or professional help objectives, but are generally finance, business, or startup oriented.

\- **AI Entrepreneurs at Berkeley (AIEB)**: Accelerator and incubator for AI startups with some of the most impressive fundraising numbers from Berkeley.

\- **Blockchain at Berkeley (B@B)**: Cryptocurrency consulting and education. Richest club at Berkeley given extremely early cryptocurrency investments, which allows for tons of international travel.

\- **Undergraduate Real Estate Club (UREC)**: Real estate focused education and community. Really solid placements in real estate and finance. Welcoming vibe with many members in other clubs.

\- **Free Ventures (FreeV)**: Startup incubator and accelerator with a fellowship program, but has not had as much startup production as AIEB as of recently. Good VC connections.

\- **Berkeley Venture Capital (BVC)**: Club dedicated to teaching VC, running occasional pitch competitions and involving themselves in the Berkeley startup ecosystem.

\- **Women on Wall Street**: Haas sponsored organization dedicated to helping women place in high finance roles across the board. Super inclusive given its focus.

\- **Chinese Finance Club (CFC)**: Similar to BFC or UFA, in the sense that it is a network targeted to Chinese students to leverage to reach their professional finance goals in terms of placements.

\- **Ascend Berkeley**: Pan‑Asian focused professional student organization empowering Berkeley students with professional help across industries, with extremely variant exits. Haas sponsored.

\- **Scholars of Finance (SOF)**: National chain of clubs that aims to educate its members about finance. Does mainly research and education work on a super small scale, but no really good placements.

\- **Microfinance at Berkeley**: Consulting for small businesses pro-bono across the Bay. Wholesome community given the true pro-bono premise of the org.

\- **Haas Business Student Association (HBSA)**: Acting student government over Haas initiatives including maintaining corporate relations with sponsors, keeping social media up to date, and helping students at large. The application process is very inclusive, with many joining as general members.

\- **Berkeley International Consulting (BIC), Core Consulting Group, Optimir Consulting, Paragon Consulting, Undergraduate Economics Association (UEA), Azure, Business Review at Berkeley (BRB), Berkeley Economic Review (BER), TAMID Group, Healthcare Business Association At Berkeley (HBAB), Haas Undergraduate Black Business Association (HUBBA), Latinx Business School Association (LBSA), Berkeley Women in Business (BWIB), Piedmont Consulting Group** are all various consulting clubs with presences as well.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Final Thoughts

If you have read through all 54 of these clubs, you probably can tell that these clubs **don't have that many differences at all** which is why there is no point for a lot of people to stress about them unless you desire something that only a specific club has (e.g. industry focus, alumni network, placements at certain firms, type of work). There is no better way to truly learn about your fit other than talking to the members and asking them questions directly. *Only you will know what you truly like!*

I hope this was helpful to anyone reading, and feel free to list any thoughts you have on clubs at Berkeley specifically below. ***Negative or positive thoughts are welcome.*** All discussions are important for people to gauge whether or not clubs are right for them! And as always, Go Bears!","As a Black student and a member of one of these consulting clubs at Cal, I am interested in learning more about the pool of applicants to these clubs receive. The demographics of their applicants should be publicly released. There would be support from other students if we raised this issue on a larger platform. 

I have not experienced racism in the club I am a member of yet, but I can see how it would be difficult for students from historically underserved backgrounds to gain access. Instead, I would argue these clubs are more classist than racist. Most of the students in these clubs come from privileged backgrounds. They work very hard for a lot of the accomplishments under their belt, but a lot have had access to tremendous resources.

Regardless, classism is the cousin of racism, and the way these clubs recruit produce discriminatory outcomes.  I mean, some of these clubs don't even have a lot of white students. Some of the white org's are more diverse.  

Are these clubs as meritocratic as they market themselves to be? Not sure."
"They gave us Enron, and now the new logo. Why do ppl keep paying for them? I feel like we would have learned by now…","**Nepotism**: *the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives, friends, or associates, especially by giving them jobs.*"
"I am a freshman at Berkeley studying Economics and hopefully Data Science. I know people say not to worry about consulting clubs on campus because they're so competitive, but I really want to try my hand at it at least once. My only issue is that all of the infosessions for every single club seem to overlap next week. I initially wanted to go to the ""top"" clubs like Berkeley Consulting and Berkeley Business Society, but some of my upperclassman friends have been saying that they fell off and that clubs like Voyager Consulting are now more respected than them? I don't get it what is the lore? And I know there are other clubs like Net Impact Berkeley, Venture Strategy Solutions, etc., but which ones would actually be worth my time applying to and attending infosessions for?","Well, not entirely.  Top one looks almost half non-(East) Asian. Middle one a bit less. Bottom one very East Asian, though not exclusively (5/7 execs).

> Likewise, the majority of consulting club applicants are asian, but there's a very VERY noticable monolothic type of member that gets accepted.

Are acceptance rates actually skewed though? I'm not seeing evidence of discrimination here.  As you note, East and South Asians presumably are way more likely to apply. 

> Overall my takeaway is if you're a minority don't bother wasting your time and applying to these clubs.

Seems like a harsh conclusion to take without any numbers. Again the top one looks reasonably diverse."

i want to join a consulting club because i think it'll be helpful with my career and also for social life but i am not into drugs or hazing or anything too crazy. i've heard a lot of mixed comments about a lot of clubs on campus and wanted to know if anyone has any good advice on which clubs to avoid? or which clubs have a bad rep in general ,lol wait until you find out about greek life
is it just vibes at the socials / how attractive you are? nepotism? resume?,"There's no consulting clubs with Black leadership? If not, I'd strongly advise you to form one. You'll get buy in and support from all the big tech companies. Big tech is very inclusive. But the lack of Black and Hispanic engineers is a huge gap that the country needs to address. You making this post shows you've got some of the fire needed to make this happen."

"I’m really busy this first semester, so I don’t want to try joining any of the super competitive consulting clubs. But I am very interested in getting some experience and being involved in one that’s more low-key. Does anyone have recommendations for more laid-back, business-focused clubs?

Or eligible for PhD students to participate in projects?,"Clubs are the same in college as before in high school. Popularity based on cliques. They vote for each other for student government and on yearbook popularity surveys (best smile, best dressed, most athletic, most funny, etc). They going be gatekeeping who they want in their clubs. I don’t even bother as I don’t even care. And as in high school, I have my own closed net of friends."
"was wondering if anyone has experience on either end of this - what's it like applying to consulting clubs as a junior? i know it's not super common, but have people had overtly positive or negative experiences? if you're responsible for recruiting in your club, is there a spoken (or unspoken) policy towards juniors or transfers? 

i came into berkeley super prejudiced against consulting and never even considered it, but as some of my interests have shifted, i'm trying to see if it's something i would be interested in. my extracurricular work is pretty academically oriented so i want a change of pace + i think it would be cool to meet new people. is it worth trying?  ","sorry to say this but asians on average are just more accomplished on any objective merit-based scale. This is evident in literally everything aside from sports. You can say its due to socioeconomic background or whatever. But it's a fact that on paper, Asians are better. Any educated person would agree to this, including minorities and whites. Let me be clear, I'm not making any inherent attachments to race and the merit of an application. I'm just saying that statistically there are more Asians with better GPA, Resumes, test scores, internships etc. There's no point ignoring that.

The real world isn't your college apps. Yes, social connections matter but so does the resume screen as well as how you literally perform during the interviews. You can't expect a Holistic assessment of a club recruitment process buddy.

Another reality check for you, everyone in STEM is fucking asian in this school. I'm an international and I've been in the US for 3 years now. To this fucking day, I still cannot come to terms with the fact that I came to America and see more 100x East/South Asian people than I do white/hispanic/black people. You can walk into any STEM class and WHITE people are the minority and most of the time there isn't even >1 black person... Asian people dominate this school - SHOCKER! The people who get recruited for these clubs are mostly STEM & Business majors who are mostly, you guessed it ... ASIAN.

These consulting clubs have < 5% acceptance rate. I've never once seen a black person during any of my club interviews. I'm sure they're out there and there are black/white/Hispanic people who do apply but the number of people applying who are asian is so much higher so it's no surprise that the people that get in are mostly Asian. A lot of these clubs also literally ask applicants to remove their name and identifying information from their resumes too.

Like no shit everyone's Asian. I'm not saying nepotism doesn't exist. It absolutely does and is really bad. But tying Race to this type of nepotism is the most amount of copium anyone can take. From any objective viewpoint, there is no statistical necessity for the number of non-Asians to be anywhere equal to the number of Asians in these clubs. Unless you're asking these clubs to employ some sort of diversity hire / affirmative action policies which is honestly just more insulting to minorities at this school.

Like I said, nepotism definitely exists here. But I highly doubt that anyone is actively trying to recruit their friends only of a specific race. There is neither a subconscious nor conscious desire to make an asian monolithic culture in these clubs. Its just a fact that there's an undoubtedly high statistical likelihood that these clubs will get dominated by Asians.

It's just pure copium to say its because of race. You applied to 10 clubs and only made the interviews for 2 and didn't get past the first round for either. Now go and take a look at the number of asians who applied and did the same if not worse than you. I know several asians who applied to 10+ clubs and didn't make the first round for any. I also know many who applied to 10+ clubs and didn't even get into one at the end. It just so happens that competitive processes tend to be competitive ..."
"I have observed that there is a big hype for consulting here ever since I came to cal, there are consulting clubs everywhere and they are also extremely competitive to get in.

&#x200B;

Any help and feedback is greatly appreciated!","Not being on here asking this question, for one."
like ManagementConsulted or something else? Or are they stingey on that as well?,"As someone in a consulting club, I'd say there are three main factors: background, skills, and fit.  Some of these factors influence the seeming monoculture of consulting types that draws so much criticism, but I'm just sharing what I know (not everything that's wrong with the system).

  
Background: Every consulting club at Berkeley asks for a resume at the start of the application process, with your stats and accomplishments spelled out.  This is where someone on their executive board can see whether or not you did X science fair, had Y award, or did Z for your community.  No real way to improve this beyond the obvious, it's luck that someone in the exec views the accomplishment as 'prestigious' or did the same thing.  Best way to succeed here is min/max your high school stats.

  
Skills: After the resume round, the next step is a case interview/product interview/product challenge.  This tests your skills at the type of consulting the club conducts, and there are a few important things that go into that.  The way you present yourself, the solutions you find, and unexpectedly, the way you ask questions.  In casing, you can definitely ask right/wrong questions, so be sure to ask what gives you the most useful info during your interview.  Best way to succeed here is to run casing interviews with people you know, or ChatGPT (which I did).

  
Fit: The most subjective and controversial portion of consulting interviews.  This factor is controlled by the way you act, and can be helped if you coffee chat someone, present yourself in a unique (but not annoying/weird) way, or have a personal connection in the club.  Consulting club executive boards need an opinion on you to vouch for you, so making sure you can be remembered is important.

  
That being said, consulting is realistically difficult but not impossible to get into without the connections that so many people talk down on it for.  Without connections, I made it to the final round of a top consulting club before choosing another one and turning them down.  If you want to get in, it's basically college apps; throw your hat in the ring and see where it lands."

We all know the job market is kinda ass right now, especially for new grads. Been there, done that... it’s rough. As someone who’s been through that cycle of hell, I wanted to try building something to make it suck a little less for fellow Bears.

So I’m building something for us: a **Berkeley-only Discord** that’s more than just chat. It’s a focused **pipeline** for resume help and job referrals... no coffee chat, no fluff, no corporate vibes, just Bears helping Bears.

# The Goal

Build a no-BS space where:

* Students get resume help from people who actually know what hiring managers/recruiters want (Roast Your Resume, Get brutally honest feedback about your resume)
* Alumni refer students when they’re ready
* Everyone feels comfortable and chill asking for help and offering help

# The Roadmap

**Stage 1: Core Alumni Team**  
Right now I’m gathering a small group of grads who:

* Are working (or recently hired) and down to help
* Can review resumes and submit referrals right after
* Have 1–2 hours a week max to give back

Not looking for career coaches. Just regular folks who remember the struggle and want to help someone else through it.

**Stage 2: Early Access for Students & New Grads**  
Once we have a decent core, I’ll invite a small batch of Berkeley students/recent grads to test the system. You’ll:

* Submit your resume
* Get it reviewed by someone who's been in your shoes
* Get referred when your resume’s in good shape

This is **not** a spammy job board. It’s 1-on-1 discord help.

**Stage 3: Structured Roles + Submission System**  
We’ll build out some simple structure:

* Resume Reviewers (alumni volunteers)
* Referral Leads (people who actually submit referrals internally or submit directly to recruiters, not just a social job link)
* Submission queue with deadlines (e.g., 72-hour review turnaround)

**Why This Matters**

There are so many alumni who *would* help if someone just asked... but most students never do. They don’t know how, or it feels awkward. This fixes that. It’s all about making help **easy to ask for** and **easy to give**. No weird LinkedIn DM, no waiting three weeks for someone to “circle back.”

And let’s be real — **f\*ck cold LinkedIn DMs and coffee chats.**

No one wants to hop on a “quick 15-minute coffee chat” after a full day of work or meeting just to talk in circles and pretend we’re networking. Both alumni and students are tired. This is for people who want to cut the fluff and actually help each other get jobs — fast.

Everyone in the server will be [**berkeley.edu**](http://berkeley.edu) **verified**. No randos. Just a chill, focused space where Berkeley students and grads can connect, review resumes fast, drop referrals fast, and move on with their lives.

And yeah, it’s 100% free. The only rule? If you get a job (through this thing or not), you have to come back and help the next Bear. Review a resume. Drop a referral. Keep the cycle going. No excuses. No freeloaders. Just a low-key referral cult built on good karma and getting sh\*t done.

Not sure yet which industries we'll focus on... honestly just seeing who shows up first. Could start with tech, but if we get folks from consulting, finance, biotech, etc., we’ll adapt. Totally depends on the mix of grads who want to help.

# Interested?

# Alum: If you’re down to review a few resumes and keep refer someone now and then, drop a comment or DM me. Doesn’t have to be a big time commitment.

Students/New Grads: If this sounds like something you’d join once it’s live, plese upvote this post... I’ll slowly roll out invites once we’re ready and have enough folks who can help.

P.S. We're the same people who started the Free Food@Berkeley Discord in 2022, which turned out to be pretty successful... That was fun, now we’re just looking to build something new that’s actually useful. Hope you'll be part of it. Thanks for reading all this

"IDK why this needs to be said but I talked to hella freshmen who were applying to consulting clubs for the prestige but wanted to go into things like SWE and didn't care ab consulting. That's a really bad idea bro. Those clubs are going to suck up so much of your time--it genuinely isn't worth it. You're better off joining a club that's closer to your actual interests or just doing professional development on your own. Otherwise you won’t have time for the things you care about.

Your time is valuable. You should spend it on things that matter. Really think about the cost of the time you're spending on things that aren't relevant for you.",reading this is honestly exhausting. what is this dumb high school shit

# Disclaimer to all students

At this point, the 61B lecture is over. If you want to go, you can. But this is actually my last lecture for the semester. Justin is lecturing the rest of the way; it's all optional fun stuff. Since this is my last chance to talk to you all, and also to those out in the recording in the world, I have a couple of things I want to say. I want to make it clear that this is only on my behalf. Like nobody on the 61B staff knows about this. No one actually knows about this, period. Like Justin, do you know what I'm about to say at all? Like I haven't told you, right? Okay.

I just wanted to leave you with some thoughts about life, and what you've learned, and what you can take forward from this class in general. That's what I want to talk about. This lecture is over, so if you want to go, you can go. You can just pretend that I have left and then I just came back, and this is a lecture hall that no one is using. Is that fair? Everyone knows the lecture is over. You can go home. I'm not here as your instructor or whatever. I'm just some guy who found an empty lecture hall and is here talking. Is that fair? Okay, I am recording this. Yeah, okay. Hopefully, it's okay with everyone. I just want to make sure.

With that in mind, again, if you want to go, leave halfway through. I don't care. Something I do want to say is, I mean, this is something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about, and something I've been spending my weekends thinking about as well.

&#x200B;

# Some context

I don't know if you all have been following the news or whatever, but there's been a situation going on in Gaza. The news stories that come out just break my heart, man. They've been bombing hospitals, they've been bombing schools, and they've been killing journalists, children, women. The thing about Gaza, which I don't know how many, you know, I had to learn as well and get informed too, but is everyone aware that in Gaza, you can't leave? This is not, ""Oh, I can just go somewhere else, whatever."" There's a blockade happening there by the Israeli government, and it means that the people inside cannot leave. There's no option to go. There's no airport to leave. There are no boats taking people out. It is a closed, open-air prison is what people are calling it because you can't leave.

That is something that I think maybe a lot of people don't realize, but I wanted to get the word out there. Something else is that, because there's this blockade, resources can't go inside either. This blockade means that the Israeli government gets to decide what goes in and out (correction: Rafah border crossing is controlled by Egypt, but Israel has cut off all humanitarian aid to Gaza from its border crossings). So they have stopped the flow of electricity. These people inside don't have power to power their hospitals or cook food. They don't have water. They don't have food. Supplies are running out. There are hospitals that just can't function because they've been bombed or because there's no electricity to support it.

The reason why I'm saying all this, by the way. I'm sorry to throw all this emotion on you, but I'll link it back to 61B and why we're all here in just a moment. I just wanted to make sure we're all aware of the situation. If you're not, literally just go on Google. The horror stories I see every day break my heart.

&#x200B;

# Qualifying my position

So, at this point, I know that people are about to come for my job. I was already told I shouldn't be doing this. Before you come for my job or whatever, I need to dispel a couple of things. I know when I'm talking to my bosses, they'll say, ""Oh, you didn't condemn Hamas,"" whatever. Hopefully, I have made it very clear that I am not in favor of bombing innocent civilians in hospitals, schools, whatever.

But I also do want to remind you all that the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back. That's not how that works. You don't just say, ""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?

I also want to remind you that history did not start in October. We were here talking about Java before October. There were things that happened before the attacks in October. There's 75 years of Palestinian history of oppression, ethnic cleansing, genocide that's been happening for the past 75 years. There have been people in Palestine who've been taken political prisoner for decades and haven't been awarded a fair trial or anything at all.

So, sure, we talk about releasing the Israeli hostages, and I'm in favor of that too. But let's also, at the same time, not be afraid to talk about the Palestinian hostages who are being held by the Israeli government. Let's not be afraid to talk about the hostages who are in Gaza and cannot leave. I think that's a hostage situation too.

If anyone wants to accuse me of being a terrorist sympathizer or whatever, I want to make it very clear that I'm not, and that's not what I'm here for. If you want to also come to me, ""Oh, you're anti-Semitic and anti-Israel,"" I want to make it clear that anti-Semitism is not anti-Zionism. They are different things.

When I was out here, by the way, these are all my own photos from the past four, five weekends (showing slides containing images of local pro-Palestine demonstrations). When we are out here, I'm not standing against my Jewish brothers, sisters, and siblings, but I'm standing with them because we say that we don't want this to happen again and not in their name. I just wanted to get that out there in case I get fired or whatever. I am not sympathizing with terrorists or anything that may be interpreted that way.

&#x200B;

# Why I care about this

So, I realized I just dropped a lot of stuff on you. Now I want to bring it back to why this matters to you, why this matters to me. You might be thinking, ""Credit to you for saying this, but this isn't the only thing that's happening in the world. Why haven't you talked about anything else that's been happening?"" And you know what? Maybe you're right. But one other thing that I really want to emphasize that makes this so important to us and makes it so that this is not something that's just happening to other people in the world who are, you know, on the other side of the globe, why does it concern me? It's who is funding this.

The US is the biggest backer of Israel and its current bombing campaign in Gaza. My tax dollars are being used to fund the bombing of children, hospitals, schools, universities, safe zones. As someone who is funding this, I think I have a right to say something against it. I did not consent to using my money for this. You might say, ""Let's just go vote out the people who said this."" But who do I vote for? I look in the Senate. They're voting like 97 to 0 to give Israel more funding. In the Senate, 97 to 0 means everyone from Ted Cruz to Bernie Sanders votes for it. Do you know how hard it is to get Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to agree on something? And they agree on this. Give me a break.

So, I think if my tax dollars are being used to fund this, and your tax dollars are being used to fund this, I think I have a right to say something about it in the space that I have. Maybe it's selfish of me to say, ""Oh, I have a space here to talk about it,"" but I think you do too. This is where I'm going to bring it back to 61B.

&#x200B;

# How this relates to you

So, what have you learned in this class? Sure, I could sit here and tell you all about, oh, we learned about a summary of sorting, we talked about priority queues, but, you know, to be realistic, are you really going to remember what radix sort is in like 10 years without looking it up? Probably not. Okay, and that's okay. I'm not offended. You know, I didn't remember what LLRB's where before I came and taught this class again, and that was like, you know, five, six years ago for me.

But what I really want you to take away from this class personally, and maybe everyone else has different opinions, and that's okay, but I think that from 61B, what you have gained is the power to be successful. I don't know how else to say this really, but you've gained the privilege to get a Berkeley degree in computer science, which is not just some crummy piece of paper. The Berkeley degree in computer science or data science is going to unlock so many opportunities and paths for you to be successful out there.

You can go out and get a software engineering job that pays twice or three times whatever the hell I make. You can go out and do consulting work or engineering and build amazing, complicated things and contribute to massive projects that change governments, change how we live as a society, change the world. Right? If you go work for a tech company, Facebook, Google, whatever, you're changing the way in which people in the world get information.

Or if you go out and work for the government or work for any of these major companies, or go out and design self-driving cars, you're changing the way that people get around or you're changing the world, really. You have been given the power to go out and use everything you've learned in this class, the ability to write all this complex code, manage the complexity, and work with other people. You've been given the privilege and the power to go out and change the world.

So what I really want to impress on you is that because you have been given this power, I think it's important to know what that power can be used for.

&#x200B;

# The importance of ethics in technology

And I know that there's already been talk; I'm sure you've heard all about, you know, oh, there's ethics in AI and, you know, there's, uh, I don't know, you know, all these other, like, tech-related things, and you're like, ""Wait a minute, you know, this Gaza thing, sure, it's an issue, but what does it have to do with me? I'm someone who's going to work in engineering and technology. So what does this have to do with me?"" But it does, right?

So, something I've heard from all the people that I've talked to out here, and you know, I've been trying my best to listen, and I'm not going to sit up here and pretend, like, ""Well, I'm an expert, listen to me, whatever."" I'm just one guy who's trying to do his best to learn about the issues. So one thing I've heard from a lot of people which really resonated with me is that we are not free until Palestine is free. So what does that mean? Well, I think you can interpret it lots of different ways. I'm not going to tell you how to interpret it, but to me, what it means is that all of our struggles are interconnected.

So when you go out and work for something like, let's go develop some AI that's going to recognize people's faces or whatever, well, that kind of technology is something that all these armies are using to identify people and protesters and try to prosecute them. Like, that's connected. Or, you know, if you go out and work for social media companies, right? You're like, ""Wait, that's nothing to do with me. What does it have to do with all this stuff? I thought this is not related to me. I'm the CS major. Get this, like, liberal arts crap away from me.

""But, um, it's connected because if you go out and work for some social media company, like, think about all the disinformation we've been seeing about this conflict. We've been seeing, you know, I mean, heck, even the fact that people are calling it a conflict, and people think, ""Oh, it's a war between two sides that have equal capability."" It's not a war. It's a genocide. There's one side that is absolutely being wiped out and bombed indiscriminately, and I think that's something that's not getting out there. And as someone who designs social media platforms and has the ability to go and change the way in which people receive information, you too have a big place in this struggle. It's not just, ""Oh, I'm a CS major. There's nothing to do with CS."" They're connected, okay.

&#x200B;

# Funding and Priorities

And I mean, even for me, sure, I don't have a tech job or whatever, but I work in education. Even something like the education sector, I feel connected to this too. So, think about it. Has anyone had trouble getting into 61B or any other classes? Has that been something everyone's been experiencing? Once you get to the upper divs, I promise you'll have trouble getting into classes, no question, right? Has everyone been experiencing those 100-minute office hour wait times that we're trying our best to get through? You know those, right? Or even just posting on Ed, waiting two days, no answer because there's just so few of us and so many of you, right? We're all underpaid, overworked. There are too many of you coming in, but why does it have to be that way?

Why is it that, you know, I have to be here, teaching all these different classes, and all of our TAs have to, you know, we tell them not to overwork, but we end up all just doing what we can to help you, and we still can't get to all of you. Why do we have to turn you away when you need help? Well, why aren't we funded? Why is the EECS department so chronically underfunded this way? I'm not saying there's a direct correlation. I'm not going to accuse the EECS department of whatever. But as a state-funded school and as a government-funded, publicly funded university, there are priorities in this country, and somehow the priority in this country is not to fund the education that you are paying a load of tuition for.

Somehow, all this money is getting funneled into sending bombs to other countries so they can bomb children in hospitals. Like, you know, that's something that resonates with me because I think that part of my struggle to get you all the education that I think you deserve is connected to the fact that our governments are okay with underfunding the EECS Department over and over and over again until we have no money left to support any of you. Meanwhile, it seems like every time Israel needs more bombs, they can always pull up the money that they need. How? How can that be right?

&#x200B;

# It doesn't feel right

So, I find those kind of things connected. When I see the people of Palestine band together and live through really what is just some of the most horrific things, like, I've ever seen in my life, I see that stuff. I don't even know if I can watch it sometimes. Like God. And, you know, when I see this stuff, part of me, of course, feels like pity and sympathy. Part of me feels anger—anger that my tax dollars are being used to fund it, anger that your tax dollars and tuitions are being used to fund it. I mean, what kind of tuition are you paying to get this kind of subpar staff support? I'm okay with saying it. Like, we do our best, but it's ultimately not what you deserve. What kind of tuition are you paying? I paid like five figures, you know? I don't know how much are we talking these days. Has tuition gone up recently? I don't even know. Forget the housing and all that. What, 100,000, 200,000? I don't know, man. It's just so much, and you're not getting what you deserve as students.

I think that, you know, even there, the struggle is interconnected. We are connected to these people in ways that even I'm still learning about. Anyway, when I see these things, you know, some part of me feels pity and sympathy, and part of me feels anger again that I'm here and I can do anything about it. My representatives are all out there voting to send them more bombs, and there's nothing I can do about it, except I guess, you know, selfishly come up here and waste all of your time talking about this.

&#x200B;

# Standing in solidarity

Something else that I feel, which I think is so much stronger than any of those other feelings of pity or sympathy or even anger, is at a very deep level, I feel solidarity with these people. The people of Palestine are out here suffering things that I will never, ever have to suffer, God willing, and things that I will never be able to even imagine—the horrors of an entire family being wiped out. There are people whose entire families have been wiped out, and that last name just doesn't exist anymore. I just think about that, and I'm like, how can I even imagine what that's like? There are people out there who have lost their homes, have been forced to go to other places, and then still been bombed. I can't imagine what that's like.

And again, I think it's fair to feel pity and sympathy, and I think that's a valid thing to feel. But I also, on a deep level, feel solidarity. The people of Palestine give me the bravery to stand up here and tell you about this, even if it costs me my job, my reputation, whatever. Like, I think this is important enough to come up here and tell you about it. And, again, I want to remind you that all these struggles, to me, they're interconnected. So when you go out and you have the power to change the world, really—I know it sounds so utopian and like, really, but, you know, software and computer science really is one of these forefront fields.

When you go out, when you have the power to write code that is complex and the ability to manage it, and heck, the ability to take the stuff we've learned, use it in your software engineering interviews, and get all the jobs that you want, that kind of thing gives you power. It gives you privilege. You might have the money to do something about this. You might have the ability to contribute to companies that are either actively supporting or opposing or doing something about injustices like this.

&#x200B;

# Parting thoughts

Hey, maybe like 10 years down the line, there will be something else that comes up, and that's okay. I don't need you to remember any specific struggle or whatever, but I want you to remember that this overall struggle for justice, for equality, it is something that we are all in together. When you go out and when you go out with this power that we've given you, the power to, again, really change the world with the ability to program and construct software that you've been given, I just want to remind you that that power comes with a lot of responsibility. I really hope that when you go out, you remember that even though maybe CS on the surface doesn't seem connected to all of this, it is all connected. I feel solidarity with the Palestinian people. I feel that they give me the bravery to say this as an educator, and I hope they give you the bravery to go out and take a stand for things like this and do what's right.

Again, I know this wasn't super appropriate. If you want to report me and get me in trouble for it, like, fine, whatever. One other thing is, I don't feel like I'm super qualified to talk about all this either. (Asks anyone from the audience to share their thoughts afterward.) That's really all I want to say. So again, it's been a good semester. I'll still be around, of course. So, yeah, thanks for coming to all the lectures. I appreciate it. Of course, it is, you know, free Palestine all day, every day, and I want you to remember that your struggle and the Palestinian people's struggle and all of our struggles are interconnected, and I want you to remember to feel that solidarity. So, that's all I have. Thanks for your time, and I'll see you next time.

"just got rejected from a consulting club and i feel like it’s bc of my social skills which sucks cuz wtf man :( 

i was in the final recruitment stage; i had an individual interview and the social night. i think i did bad on the social night cuz last 10 mins of the event,  my vibe/energy was off (i was tired and wanted to go home) . plus the potential members i was talking to with the existing member also got cut :( 

i put so much time and effort 

are clubs even worth it.. might as well find a job/internship instead","your life is over. these club decisions directly determine your first job, all subsequent jobs, your future net worth, your chances of ever finding love, and your value as a human being. 

it is most certainly **not** a bunch of your-age-plus-one year olds deciding you’re not cool enough to hang out with them. certainly not that."
"Hey guys! I am super excited to come to Berkeley in the fall and I heard that joining clubs is a great way to get involved. I applied here as Econ and I’m really curious about consulting clubs, but there are an overwhelming amount of options. The more I look at Reddit the more confused I get haha (why is it so deep??). I’ve seen some “ranking” posts that put some clubs over others, but I wanted some more information from current students about what these clubs actually are and how they are different. Any insights will be extremely helpful so I can get a sense of what I want to apply to, thank you!","Alumni bear here. Never knew about consulting when in undergrad. Was MCB and Public Health. 

Learned later in grad school what it was, how consulting works, and made it through multiple case interviews at Deloitte, McKinsey, BCG, and boutique firms. 

Then realized I could leverage my network, didn’t really want to work for someone else and started my own firm before I was 30 (focus on organizational design and change management) and cleared mid six figures running things the way I want (no all-nighters for stupid PowerPoint decks that don’t go anywhere, rolling up my sleeves and working across all levels of the organization from frontline staff to being the EC for the csuite, etc)

Point being, when I was an undergrad, I heard my friends freak out about Haas and consulting club interviews. I promise it will mean so little in the future, and honestly now that I do know about it, find it so infuriating how elitist this is. Find alumni who work at the companies you’re interested in and reach out. You just need one to believe in you and be willing to mentor/sponsor you. Don’t let this club hold you back. Opportunities are made, no point in fighting with everyone else for the same ones."
"Hello! I'm going to be a sophomore next year and I'm hoping to join a consulting club in the fall. If my past experience is in SWE, how could I tailor my resume and extracurriculars for PMs or consulting clubs? Also which consulting clubs are good for tech + consulting? Thanks! ",why did you have to apply again
are there any that you can get into and do meaningful work in without the insanely strenuous application process? ,"Once you spend a year or two in the ""real world"" after university, you'll see how meaningless these status games are. 


There are soooo many opportunities at Cal, clubs are only one of many."
"Every day I walk to class I have to deal with these consulting clubs trying to hand me flyers and shit.

My first couple of days on campus it was kind of charming. Now it's just annoying.

I thought it would only be a one or two day thing, but these clubs are tabling every day. This does stop after a while doesn't it?

No, I don't care about your start-up that's going to fail just like 99% of the other start-ups.","I will write a post about my experience with clubs on a post soon to share my view and perspective. But as a person who’s run successful businesses, is friends with tech CEO’s, and top executives I can tell you there is nothing these clubs can offer you that you can’t find on your own. In fact, doing it on your own will make you a better candidate in my opinion for a lot of jobs. No hiring manager is holding slots for people just because they were in a club and having “connections” doesn’t exist unless the person you know is a top level executive. Take this opportunity to lock in and surpass these people, because at the end of the day these aren’t your friends they are your competition for jobs. You have been around them long enough to know their strengths and weaknesses so now use that to your advantage and adapt!"
"After reading u/Independent-Common95's post '[Don't apply to the consulting clubs/CS orgs/business frats](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hudiv0/dont_apply_to_the_consulting_clubscs_orgsbusiness/)', I was particularly moved by one quote:

&#x200B;

*""People at these clubs are not more successful that other people. These clubs perpetrate the idea that if you don’t get into their club, you won’t be successful at Berkeley. This is completely untrue.""*

&#x200B;

And I felt compelled to write this post, provide additional context, and be a resource for anybody and everybody who wants to learn more about recruiting, hunting for jobs + internships, and breaking into ""prestigious"" roles in consulting, investment banking, product management, and more.

I personally have met some of the most spectacular, genuine, amazing, inspiring, empowering, gentle, and loving people in my life here at Cal. And yes, some of them were in what I would call the umbrella term of the wider 'consulting community' (re: consulting clubs, business frats, etc.).

And just to get this out of the way: yes, I was a part of this community. I can't speak for coding clubs, design org's, or other student groups in those kinds of spaces, but I am quite intimate with the Cal business scene. And after spending these past 4 years working my ass off in this space, I can safely assure you this: we ain't SHIT.

I could aim for the low hanging fruit (re: sexual assault, racism, ridiculous and illogical recruiting practices, toxic membership practices, a complete and utter disregard for diversity and inclusion), but honestly this post isn't about them. It's about YOU, and what YOU are capable of.

The community's marketing strategy is built on the fundamentally incorrect notion that you need them in order to earn internships and full-time jobs at the hottest spots in Wall Street and Silicon Valley. One afternoon scouring LinkedIn's may convince you this is true. And if it isn't the LinkedIn stalking that does it for you, it's the endless tabling and flyering on Sproul, the deluge of information sessions, and wave-after-wave of obnoxiously branded Patagonia-wearing 20 year old's reminding you that they're interning with Morgan Stanley next summer.

In Statistics, one of the most simple but lasting concepts you'll learn about is 'Convenience Sampling'. Our perception of reality is essentially distorted by data that is easy to draw upon, but ultimately misleading. For instance, would you believe the results of a presidential election poll conducted solely on UC Berkeley students?

Hopefully you wouldn't, because our (relatively) small campus sample size is by no means indicative of our actual voting population. Likewise, our consulting club bubble is a poor representation of what the actual professional world is like.

When I interned in New York, my club had little to no network for me to reach out to. So I learned how to build my own network for myself.

That summer, I had ***over*** ***100*** coffee chats with Cal alum working everywhere from Goldman Sachs to Google, from Wall Street to up-and-coming startups and everything in-between. What surprised me was witnessing how warm, helpful, and inspiring our alumni could be.

And what may surprise you even more is how very few of these alumni actually belonged to the wider consulting club community. Of the 25 alumni I got really close with, only one came from a consulting club. And she left after spending ***only two*** semesters in it.

These people made it to the hottest, hypest positions available to undergrads. They were consultants at BCG and Deloitte. They were bankers at Goldman and J.P. Morgan. They were PM's at Venmo and Twitter. Some of them even founded their own startups. And regardless of industry and role, of major or club affiliation (or, more commonly than not, lack thereof) they were 100% killing the game.

It opened my eyes to how insane of a bubble we Cal students live in here at Berkeley. Because once you get out into the real world, you will begin to see how much potential you truly have.

Because every single year, hundreds of students - some in these clubs, and most of them not - land amazing opportunities by virtue of their OWN hard work, grit, dedication, passion, and will.

My own personal experiences - and talking with my friends, mentors, and wider network - helped me challenge my past, misguided biases and convinced me of two simple, pervasive truths.

You don't need consulting clubs. They need YOU.

Who else will wake up at the ass crack of dawn to set up shop at Sproul, pitching tents and mentally bracing oneself for a week's worth of tabling and flyering? Who else will drink the kool-aid and indoctrinate the next generation of naive freshmen and sophomores? How else will current members direct their repressed stress when welcoming new recruits (re: you) to a series of family-friendly, ASUC-approved wholesome ice breaker activities (re: hazing)? Who else will uphold the legacy of prestige, most of which is flimsily held together by a pathology of poorly-disguised inferiority complexes?

So go out there and get that bread. Join clubs because **you** want to join them, because its members excite you and inspire you, and not because they claim to have a fast-track pass to the Goldman Sachs (hint: they don't). Make friends in the unlikeliest of places. Don't be afraid to shoot your shot DM'ing cool people on LinkedIn. You never know what you'll find.

In fact, I wouldn't be where I am today with having taken those risks. And neither will you.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr** Membership in these clubs is neither validation of your personal/professional worth nor affirmation of your success in the real world. Only *you* have the power to determine that.

&#x200B;

**P.S.** Feel more than free to DM me if you have any questions or just want to talk. I know this is Reddit, but screw anonymity (this isn't my actual Reddit account anyway), and DM me here on Reddit if you want to chat and/or talk about anything recruiting, college, or postgraduate life!","gave up on consulting clubs they beg for useless projects from big companies to show off the logos 😭 they just do a whole bunch of bullshit and be intimidating about it 😁 anyone can be a consultant it’s just solving other peoples and company problems so just go about life and develop your interests, i swear 9/10 times you can consult for any major (literally even an art consultant for a building or residential place or whatever) 

this is getting a bit personal cause i was caught up in applying to consulting clubs too but biz majors have classes like “leading people” bffr you don’t need to learn that at a school rather be taking sociology or psychology and get the same effect i promise you they all just leverage the network later on with the club alumni

there are so many other clubs on campus that are much more welcoming and not elitist where you can contribute to actual causes and interests you care about over resume workshopping and making a slide deck the company doesn’t even care about :)"

During high school I did a lot of volunteering and have multiple experiences in having a leadership position. Thank you.

Can't believe it took yall two weeks to despawn.,"alumni bear here i graduated this past may: don’t worry about it trust me. during my undergrad i realized a lot of consulting clubs at berkeley have a very cult like personality and they pick and choose at their own will. there is no logic behind it and the faster you understand that, the happier you are going to be. 

when i was a junior i applied to a club (i was already president of another club not consulting) but my friends wanted me to do it for fun, after the first interview i didn’t get in and i felt like a loser. fast forward to summer i got this internship and job at a good brand and that following fall that SAME club and another consulting club reached out to me begging me to partner with them. what i did was i decided to join the other club for fun and they didn’t even accept me 🤣 even though they were begging to partner and consult for my brand and asking me to be the middle man? (also my company did not give a shit about their consulting projects because we were actually focused on making revenue and not wasting time) after rejecting me, they still didn’t leave me for over a year😭 they would constantly ask me on linkedin and send me emails asking for partnering opportunities. this just goes on to show how desperate and pathetic sometimes they are. i was literally working for a brand already that they were BEGGING to partner with and they didn’t want to be around a person like me whom they might get jealous of because stating facts, I was already doing what they wanted to do in their future. im sharing my story because its super funny to me how consulting clubs on campus seem like an important factor in your career when they aren’t. be true to yourself, join clubs that resonate with your passion, do side projects, companies care more about that. heck yeah even cold email companies asking for project opportunities as an undergrad. this is a blessing in disguise and now you can stay away from these clubs and actually focus on your own life and career because tbh those clubs don’t do much but suck your soul. if you ever need advice, im happy to help!"
"Hello everyone! I saw Voyager Consulting was recruiting and I'm thinking of applying to join them or another club this semester. 

Are there any good consulting clubs that would be a good fit for a Business Administration major, public policy minor?

"I made it to the final round of a consulting club I really wanted to join. I have my final interview tomorrow. It's a case project that I have to spend hours working on today, and I really don't know if it will be worth so much of my time.

Which one should I give up?","A lot of the people who were interviewing you have never had an internship, yet are the arbiters of who is allowed into their club or not.

"Graduated last May with 3.5 GPA (EECS). Worked at a startup part-time post-college that went under. It’s been five months since that ended. I rarely get interviews despite networking my ass off, grinding personal projects, leetcoding, etc. I apply for jobs that pay 60k (SWE roles, QA, etc.). I apply to FAANG roles — rarely even get an OA. And of course, I’m always applying to New Grad and Associate roles. I don’t know what to do but really need a job. Any advice?

I’m thinking of headhunters, consultancies, doing research at a local university etc. 

EDIT: Thank you for all the information and advice so far.

I have gotten my resume reviewed a number of times (at the career center, by industry professionals, etc.). 

It really does mean a lot to have people I’ve never met helping me through this out of sheer kindness. It can be a cold world at times so this has been an especially nice reminder of the Berkeley spirit.

I’m not sure how, but I’ll get a job and will pay it forward 10x.

Any reccs? Willing to pay avg/above avg, just wanna get the job done perfectly","I was flabbergasted to learn joining a club at Cal has become so competitive.  As an alumni who does a good amount of hiring let me tell you this …. these clubs have a minuscule (or zero) impact on you getting a job.  Yes it looks good to have a well rounded resume, but that can easily be done with volunteering with an organization that may or may not be associated with Cal.  There is so much need in the East Bay.  People need help with all sorts of things … help school kids with math or science, volunteer at a homeless shelter, volunteer at the SPCA, get involved at a local environmental group.  Help organize events.  Look for opportunities to lead an initiative with these organizations.

Honestly Cal was MUCH BETTER when we had affirmative action.  Kids today at Cal are too round up.  It’s not good to have everyone on the same mind set of achieve-achieve-achieve!  Slow down.  My god get high and have a few drinks!   Do kids even have fun anymore?!?  Clubs are supposed to be extracurricular activities.  Heck do what my friend did and CREATE your own club.  Looks way better on a resume.

And to go back to my original point, all your extracurriculars barely get glanced at.  It’s sort of a high/medium/low assessment.   I see this person went to Cal (most notable), they have a degree in X (second most notable), and I see a medium amount of words under activities (least important).  

Then of course when you get “real” experience the entire education section of your resumes gets demoted in importance even further.  Sure the institution and degree still matter but they are more there to round out story of you … “Here is a gal who has 4 years of experience as a Data Scientist at X company, oh BTW and I see she went to Cal, that tracks, and I’ll put her a little higher in a pile of people with similar experience, but she is still lower than those with more relevant experience and career accomplishments.”  At this point your activities associated with Cal become even less important."
"When I first came to Berkeley, I honestly didn't have that much on my resume. Still, I managed to get past first and second round interviews for many clubs and in fact, get in! Once I was on the other end, I'd find out that some of them had 10% acceptance rates and I managed to get in as a ""lowly"" freshman.

But now, as an upperclassman, my GPA has improved. My resume is much stronger. I started using active rather than passive voice and acquired relevant extracurriculars to paint a much more cohesive story, including campus jobs to afford life in Berkeley. Maybe that's what turned them off, because a lot of them are almost 20 hours a week and consulting clubs say their expected time commitment for new members is 8-12.

I've just been rejected from the consulting clubs I've applied to. I didn't even make it past the resume round, so no interview. I know this sounds kind of arrogant, but I'm wondering what happened because if anything, I feel like I've improved and am a stronger applicant than when I was a freshman and just trying to figure things out. But a lot of the current members of the clubs I talked to said they were all freshmen and had very little on their resumes and got in. I'm a little sad because I was really curious about consulting and wanted to learn more through a club. I also know a lot of these clubs have really strong profdev opportunities and was excited, especially since it's hard to get an appointment through the career center. I just wanted to make friends and network, that's all.

Again, apologies if I come off as arrogant or anything like that--I'm just generally a little baffled and disappointed.",Suck it up. Get over it. You're not privileged.

"I want to do consulting as a career after college, so I think joining a club to get some early experience could be super helpful. However, it seems like all the clubs value their “community and culture” and have swanky projects with F500 companies. 

I know that some differ in the sense that they might emphasize different verticals, like healthcare or tech, so there’s that. I also know that some clubs charge fees while others don’t, but does that have any implication beyond the kind of events they can host?

When I apply to do consulting professionally, it just doesn’t seem like the name of the consulting club will be that significant. I speculate that they’d probably care most about my tangible experience among other factors.

Does anyone know any more about this? I’m curious if the “prestige” of the club will actually be beneficial or if it’s all just arbitrary.",Was in the same situation last week!

"I’m just feeling a little down about clubs. I went to every event and put so much effort into the application and I still didn’t get an interview. I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong, other than the fact that I don’t already know someone in the club. This is also the second time around (freshman) and it just sucks bc there’s so many opportunities and I just keep getting rejected. It just makes me sad, especially seeing everyone around me get interviews or get in. Any advice for trying again :/ ?",Not all consulting clubs are 100% Haas students but also a lot of consulting clubs do shit like this from my experience
"I'm a freshman looking to apply to Haas and get a dual degree in business. My professors say the most helpful thing is internships, and I know consulting clubs can connect you to them. I figure there's always some good working experience with them as well. 

Should I try to apply to some this semester? ","Private apartment buildings like The Standard have rooftop decks and lounges and other indoor spaces for the use of residents.  Have your friend who lives there ask the building management for any written policies about reserving lounges and common outdoor spaces for private use. 

Generally, those spaces are supposed to be for the use of all of the residents of the building. I don't know about that building in particular.  

But those types of buildings get their development permits from the City based on their representations of what will be provided in the buildings--and one of the things they often represent is ""useable open space"" for the residents, like rooftop decks, and lounges. 

It's one thing if a resident has a birthday party or something in a lounge--it's another if the lounges / roof decks are being regularly taken away from the majority of the residents for use by outside groups (regardless of whether a member of that group lives in the building.)"
"I am an incoming freshman, and I'm interested in getting involved with the consulting community at Berkeley. However, I know that the consulting groups at Berkeley are highly selective, so I'm wondering if it would even be worth applying during my first and second semesters.

What is their selection process like and is it worth to get in?

Also one of my friends told me that they do not take in transfer students. Is there a reason behind that?","I live in hope that one day people with that sort of attitude pull it on the wrong person (i.e. someone they're about to be interviewing with).

Anyone willing to look my consulting club essays?,They are called Haasholes for a reason.
"Hi all, I recently got admitted to berk, ucla, and usc for econ as a transfer. I plan to break into MBB after I graduate. Is berk a target school for MBB? Or does usc and ucla place better? 

Also, will being a non-haas student be a significant disadvantage during recruiting? 

Lastly, does one have to join the top consulting clubs at berk to even have a shot at MBB? I’m a junior transfer so these clubs most likely won’t accept me :(

"I'm a freshman EECS major at Cal, and didn't end up joining any clubs my first semester because I wanted to focus on generally getting used to Cal and getting an internship for the summer. Now, however, I kinda realize that my social circle/network isn't very big and I honestly want to meet more people involved with tech, and have a better overall social scene.

Fortunately, I was able to get a FAANG internship for the summer, so I'm not too worried about resume value etc, and I'm more interested in working on **genuinely** cool projects and having a good time.

I know a lot of the tech/consulting clubs here have a reputation for being prestige competitions, but I'm wondering if there are any that actually do interesting work(that don't require too much knowledge beforehand). Currently I'm thinking about Valley, Venture, and Voyager for consulting and Launchpad, ML@B, Blockchain and Codebase(although I'd prefer not just doing full stack stuff) for core tech.

Do you guys have any opinions about these clubs and/or do you think there are better ways to get involved with the tech community here while also having a good social scene(I'd like to go on retreats etc)? I know research is one option, but I'd prefer something slightly more real-world and social.",Don’t let them punk you like that… ever
"I applied to all the major Berkeley consulting clubs (10 of them). I have internships at 4/5 FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google), have a 3.8 GPA in EECS and have done extensive PM interviews even making it to the final round for Google APM intern interview (last year). I also had really good essays on all my applications that were read by an alumni of BC, yet I somehow I didn't get to the interview stage for even 1 of the consulting orgs. What am I missing? Is it really possible these are that competitive? Do most applicants even freshman have even more work experience at better companies or better grades than this? I was surprised I couldn't even get interviews at the tech focused ones.",Tell him you consulted with your colleagues and determined the best course of option would be for you to order seconds and chew each bite at least ten times for improved digestion

,"From what I've seen you won't be missing much. 


It's an elitist circle-jerking clique culture focused on building useless decks and PowerPoints (copy and pasted with the help of ChatGPT) that no one and not even the firm you're trying to represent cares about only in hopes of getting a job interview after graduation. 


They did you a favor by rejecting you, you'll be saving a ton of energy and stress not being apart of that mess.


If you're a business or econ major, intern independently with a local business and see how you like it. You only need one person, one company to give you a chance to help mentor and give you the networking skills needed post-graduation.


And if you ignore everything I just said and still want to go to those toxic clubs, remember you're only a freshman and you have 3 years left.

,pick the one with the ppl you like most :)
,"I mean take my advice with a grain of salt but from what I’ve seen and heard from friends in the consulting community, BC and BBS have fallen off in terms of projects and placements. They have just been riding off their reputation and name but you are better off choosing a consulting club where you genuinely like the community and could see yourself spending four years of your college career with them. Like a lot of people in this community say, consulting clubs are really not that deep and a lot of the overhyped prestigious clubs have a lot of assholes.

That said, a lot of clubs are known to have great communities. I’ve heard great things about ppl in NIB, 180, Venture, TBG, etc. If all you want is the name on your resume, BC is probably still your best bet? But not as good as you think anymore from what I can tell."
,"Literally just apply to the clubs you like and join the one with an environment that you believe suits you. At the end of the day, networking and actual internship matter more than your club (all should have good alumni networks). The rankings are literally pointless because even if club A is ""better"" than club B what real difference does it make?"
,"Daughter is part of a consulting club. Not one of the super competitive or well known ones, but that’s fine with her (and me). She joined with her friends and to make new friends and I think it’s been good for her to learn how to take on certain responsibilities, to speak and interact with people, and to do certain projects. It’s a win win situation as long as the group you’re with is a good group who learns how to work together and tries to just get experience with networking and learning how to be responsible. 

It’s like anything else in college, it’s a good tool to learn, mature, and to grow."

,">but i am not into drugs or hazing or anything too crazy

Yea dawg that's almost every damn club on campus ESPECIALLY consulting clubs lmfao 😂 Almost every club social activity has drinking and drugs at their internal events... Welcome to college lol

The sad reality you'll never really ""fit in"" or be ""that guy"" if you're not comfortable with doing any of these things, and that's fine. You can still join the club, do your job, and just not go to the social events. Hazing exists but not nearly as bad as the frats

If you're anywhere from slightly to insanely narcissistic and like flexing staying at 5 star hotels, ""business"" dinners at Michelin restaurants, and racking up a shit ton of miles and status with airlines all on the company's dime after graduating, consulting is perfect for you

- interviews: basically, don’t be an asshole, we look for behavioral red flags in how you talk and interact with others, and we do actually grade you on your casing (it’s at least 50% of your score) both on getting the right answer and how you approach the problem even if you don’t get it right

,"Uhhh I think there’s a list of them circulating somewhere, I’ll post it if I find it here"
,"Take this with a grain of salt as when I was there there was no four year program so everyone was applying sophomore year or transfers. I think that does matter as there’s probably way more limited space given an entire new category of students at haas which means things may be more competitive than they were before.

The advice I got was that they want applicants to showcase their four pillars as well as want an applicant to show that they will be successful with or without the program. Essentially, what they want to see is that you’re engaged and have a plan for yourself that you believe the curriculum it has will help you with, not that the name brand of the program will make or break your path. In simple terms would taking an introduction to private equity class actually help you for your own career ambitions, not convince you to go into private equity. Given that at least when I applied, it seemed like the traditional accounting, banking, consulting students didn’t do as well in applications compared to students who did more fun clubs, or unique clubs, but showed leadership potential. Essentially, it seemed like kids who ran the anime club for example and wrote about that experience typically grabbed Application readers more than being a member at Berkeley finance club. People have gotten in with demonstrated interest in a typical business careers, but the typically wrote about it and showcase a particularly unique aspect of that career, for example, wanted to go into environmental consulting or wanting to do investment banking for new tech companies to help grow them versus simply to make money. All this is to say I wouldn’t join a club in particular to apply to the program because that is not a guaranteed thing, but I would join a finance club if you feel like that club‘s actual knowledge And network could improve your life, or that the social connections will be a fun time. I would think of the club choice as an independent decision from the application.

In terms of clubs, Berkeley finance club is the most well known and connected. They do things like pitching a stock, intro to basic financial statements, how to do well in banking interviews, etc. However, in my experience, they have a history of hazing and heavy drinking, so to me if you believe you can gain a lot of that knowledge on your own via your own research then I wouldn’t think it’s worth it, but it is a good one stop shop for all the information you would need. I believe there’s a similar accounting society and a consulting club on campus, but I don’t have much knowledge there.

Instead, I would actually target on doing an internship either while at school or in the summer. If you can land a pretty interesting professional experience that will do much better on your application than a club would, as it shows genuine integration into the workforce."

,If you're getting a PhD I think your path diverged from consulting clubs a long time ago. They're just an excuse to party and put something on a resume. Hopefully you aren't looking to party with undergrads and I doubt a consulting club would add anything to your resume
,Yes it’s actually called PhD Consulting Club! I think the email is phdconsultingclub@gmail.com
,"You can definitely do it and I think it's very much worth trying! I think it's always a good sign if you see that the club has a lot of members who joined as a junior (as a freshman admit or transfer), which you can see during their recruitment events.

There are sooo many consulting clubs that have all different niches and purposes, so you should have a lot of options!

If anything, something I noticed is that people who join clubs as a freshman usually burn out or ""retire"" by the time they hit their junior year (or join another club), so I would almost argue juniors are more likely to be more ""productive"" members of a consulting club.

,It’s a well paying job for non-STEM people you can get straight from undergrad with good exit options.

,"I once asked someone who was tabling for a consulting club this exact question. His eyes glazed over as soon as I asked and he was suddenly more interested in flagging down people walking by then talking to me lol. My guess is that they kind of perpetuate themselves. Because there are so many, people keep making more. I think it might also be because these clubs can get little gigs from businesses whereas more ""traditional"" clubs don't have that kind of overlap with the ""real world"". Just my 2c"
,It's funny how they advertise their recruitment but accept few people. Like 🤣🤣. Are you open like the Marine Corps during Vietnam with your advertisement? Or are you like a mini Harvard in exclusivity. To me it doesn't make much sense to advertise yet take very few people.
,"I think it has actually just become a replacement word for ""contractor."" Real consulting requires experience in the field, so becoming a ""consultant"" straight out of college doesn't actually make any sense. Either way, it's weirdly hyped here."
,"I am not trying to hate at all, and I suppose this comes from a place of my own ignorance, but I have been trying to understand what exactly consultants “consult” on. Like engineering consulting, financial consulting, image/brand consulting, then OK, those are specific areas of expertise one grows over time, and I get that, but when people basically with no base expertise say that want to get into consulting, I just wonder, what are you going to consult on? What expertise will you have to offer? Or is it just consulting for the sake of consulting? I guess I just don’t get it. Could someone please help me understand? Again, I get I am ignorant on this. Thanks."
,"Job also involves a lot of traveling that can be expensed through the company. Some friends built up a lot of mileage points and then went on trips. 

Also depending on what type of consulting, you can pivot your career too. A lot of MBA students also tend to have background in consulting from what I have heard.

I think HAAS kids used to recruit mainly for the ABCs (accounting, banking, and consulting)"

,And why there are so many consulting clubs in Berkeley…
,"Consulting clubs that actually do something real are worth looking into. Thing is, most of them don't."
,"Being on the work side for a few years I can tell the difference between someone who's been in a consulting club and someone who hasn't. (FYI I don't work for a consulting, accounting, finance, law firm.) They know how to present. I can slam them in a meeting and they can go with a deck they've seen for the first time 10 minutes ago. For noobs, in case you don't know being able to present is 75% of professionalism. Speaking of decks, they know what one is, can make one, tear it down and re-build it better. I can leave them with the client for a moment and not worry about losing the account or heaven forbid, them asking the client for a job. Myself, I've never been in a consulting club (wish I had been and given myself a boost up), I just see the results. And sometimes hire them."
,"Credit card churning is a hobby of mine - the sapphire preferred bonus is only 75k right now, OP is confusing it with the much more luxurious, much less necessary or justifiable Chase Sapphire Reserve which costs $795 per year just to hold. 

Anyway, this is basically an ad and should be taken down."
,![gif](giphy|iH7kfwoxKsmgTHvNTg)
,"Honestly, I think the real value of consulting clubs is to make friends.

Then if those friends manage to get hired by a company you have an ""in.""

So to build connections in case you get in a situation where you can't find a job and gotta be like, ""Hey man, put in a good word for me at your job. I wanna apply there."""
,"It's mostly just networking and interview prep. It's not at all necessary to get into consulting, I landed a consulting internship paying me $46/hr with no prior experience besides retail. They may help, but not that much."
,"They give advice, so basically imagine that you want to wear a hermes bag and you approach the Gucci Gang Squad consulting club for some advice. They're gonna be like ""No sweetie, I don't think so"". 

I suspect that my neighbors are majoring in consulting since all they do is babble and party 24/7."
,![gif](giphy|58SdhZruTe7603YV6E|downsized)
,"Consulting clubs are useful as far as providing resources for case prep and perhaps some opportunities to network with firms. Beyond that, the value of the “projects” they work is negligible to the companies and perhaps a better version of interview prep for the club members. These clubs are neither necessary or sufficient to get into consulting."
,"That’s a great question, and they will be better prepared to give you a more comprehensive answer in the near future, depending on what times work for you next week"
,"i asked, and they said they’re Gen Z-ers who help companies. 👍"
,"That's what I'm saying lol

I mean, I admire students for their hustle but i mean like what do ya'll even do?"

Best for Big Tech: Berkeley Consulting

Best for Social Impact: The Berkeley Group

Best for Coding: CodeBase

Best for Product Management: Product Space

Best for Marketing: magical|

Best for Art: Berkeley Innovation"

,"None, consulting clubs are a meme

If there is a semester's long interview process or 'competitions' to join the club, it's a trap."
,"None, it’s not worth it."
,I’m about to graduate soon and I literally still don’t know what a consulting is and why people join them (MechE)
,"a lot of people are saying don’t but im in 2 of them and i enjoy it sm!! feel free to dm me if you want more advice but i can give you basic rundown:

data/tech consulting:
- any club with data in their name (data good, data story, idk the rest but chances are they all do the same thing
- valley consulting (one of the more “upper tier” clubs, can be hard to get into
- upsync consulting

product/design:
- berkeley innod 
- productspace 
- any club with innovation/design in their name

nonprofit/social impact:
- grc (global research & consulting)
- 180 degrees consulting
- the berkeley group (TBG)

if you’re also interested in finance: 
- microfinance at berkeley (they consult for small companies i believe)

healthcare-specific:
- hcg (healthcare consulting group)
- phoenix

entertainment/media: 
- BCEC

general consulting:
- for these, honestly they all do the same thing. i would say personally just go to infosessions for anyone that you’re interested in, talk to the people and just get a gauge on vibe so you can narrow down your options
- you can do like a mass apply (10+ clubs) but lowkey it’s rlly not that worth it, its a waste of your time, and these clubs talk to each other anyways so they all know what you’re applying to
- focus on making yourself stand out in coffee chats, interviews, and everything else as that’s really the code in my opinion to getting into these clubs
- if you’re rejected, it’s not that big of a deal either! at the end of the day they’re also just students lol and they honestly have no say in how your future trajectory is going to follow anyways so don’t take anything too personally"
,"They are mostly overrated, and useless if you are in CS, but if you really want to go down this route, Berkeley Consulting is probably the best."
,"theres good recs in the comments but overall i wouldn’t suggest it, its cliquey and overall process is super competitive with no actual advice when it comes to interviews (lucked based and how they feel about you) and i also had internships on my resume when i was applying (CS)"
,"You need to declare- look at the minor’s webpage to know the requirements for that. Next, you’ll need to talk to that department’s advisor, and typically they’ll have a form or something you need to fill out. Boom! Declared. Yippee"
,Yes. Go in with what courses you want to take when to fulfill the minor requirements to the advisor. Then tell them your plan.
,"I think your framing is kinda naive. Yes, if you do everything right to get a 90k+ paying finance job (clubs, gpa, networking), you’ll get a 90k+ paying finance job."
,"Yay, something I can answer! I was in Haas, and did IB for a bit. I would say the following on your questions:

1. That salary is actually very easy to accomplish considering bonus too. In IB, base has risen to 100k out of college, with bonus ranging from 40%-90% of salary depending on bank, year, and personal performance. I have seen people 2 years out of college make $200k all in or more. I say this as if your loan payment schedule only needs about 90k a year, that opens you up to a lot of different career choices outside of just IB or consulting. FP&A is often a lower stress role and safer, and is much easier to get into. People often start at 80-85k, and at larger firms into the 90s. The point is especially in the Bay starting salaries for most financial jobs will hit this mark, so really calculate the minimum needed for the loan to be sustainable. The median starting salary out of Haas for all jobs is 90k ([https://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad/the-value-of-a-haas-degree/careers/](https://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad/the-value-of-a-haas-degree/careers/)). From a pure money standpoint, its much more common for folks to directly go into PE as an analyst and that can have carry from deals, essentially allowing your earning potential to expand rapidly. 
2. IB / Consulting are very competitive, but thats often only because out of Cal (Econ and Haas) people really are only targeting tech investment banking roles in the Bay or in the case of consulting either here or in NY. There are plenty of boutique M&A shops across the country that would love a Cal grad, so long as you are willing to relocate or start your career in a less-desirable specialization (say, industrials M&A or moving to Kansas). There is interesting data from Haas and econ about where people end up going, and its 83% stay in California for Haas from last year's class. [https://career.berkeley.edu/start-exploring/where-do-cal-grads-go/](https://career.berkeley.edu/start-exploring/where-do-cal-grads-go/). 
3. On the loan, the big issue I have with this is that **TONS** of people think like you do and think they can handle IB, and in reality its a 70-90 hour a week job with very few weekends off, constantly being pinged by management and all suffering is deemed ""part of the job"" due to high pay. Many, including myself, started IB thinking I would be in it for the long haul only to discover its one of the most shallow, money focused industries and those who thrive either love money so much that they are willing to sacrifice their lives for it or have vices so expensive they need to pay for it. No joke, many talk about the ""analyst 25"" which is analysts gaining 25 pounds of weight due to lack of exercise and poor eating habits, and the industry has a suicide problem. I say all of this in that you dont want to get a loan thinking you have plenty of money to pay it off in IB or consulting and you are forced to make a choice 2-3 years down the line between your financial safety and your mental health. Its common for analysts to quit after 2 years, not because they planned it but because the industry weeds so many out. I would say if you can get the loan down to where just having a normal job can help pay it off it would allow more freedom for you, so maybe pick up a part-time job while in college, or just space out your college so you dont have to take one. Another way is to start investing, as many jobs would actually like this experience and you may be able to pay for it yourself.

Always happy to answer more specific questions in the DMs."
,"near impossible to predict and I wouldn't take out loans on that kind of projection. You could graduate in a good or shitty job market year.  That starting salary is not unreasonable - you might also find you have to take a entry level job with a big huge back at 55k,.  You just don't know."
,I wouldn’t bank on it but it’s very doable in my opinion.
,"Haas undergrad ‘21 here.

Yes, it is possible. 100k comp is standard especially if you are pursuing those roles.

However, it’s heavily contingent on if you stay in that role long enough to pay the loans off. Consulting, especially IB, have very brutal hours.

There are plenty of boutique IB firms that also pay $100k+. So broaden your search. Also consider business roles in tech, which I ended up in. The WLB is very nice and the pay is solid for fresh out of undergrad.

I would first consider the loan size + interest and then project the monthly payments out based on the expected salary and payment timeline. As an example, I would suggest aiming to pay off a 40k loan within a year - which is very doable if you’re aggressive and understand the exact amount you need to pay on a $100k+ comp.

Or you can be a degenerate like me and take out a $25k student loan during Covid at a 0% interest, buy long dated options contracts on Costco, hold and pray, then sell enough to cover the loan balance and let the rest ride."
,"Median salary for econ grads is about 85K. 

https://career.berkeley.edu/start-exploring/where-do-cal-grads-go/"
,"bruh i get talking abt salary is odd and very simple-minded, but y'all who are downvoting know nothing about how stressful getting a potential loan is. I'm just tryna guage whats out there as I dont have much network regarding these things"
,Not exactly related to OP’s post but does anyone know international students who are aiming to/have been able to get this type of job? I would love to know how possible it is with all the visa concerns. Thanks!
,"Starting salary’s not the important thing to worry about in IB/consulting, growth is. But yes, 100k+ is doable."
,"Try core consulting group, they are centered around being more inclusive"
,"The clubs first priority is obviously to do work but it’s also to be a fun group. As a senior, you’re only going to be there for two semesters. You won’t be there that long and will most likely forget about them after a year. I’d suggest just finding part time work to do during the year rather than getting into the club

To answer your question though, you probably won’t have a shot of getting in. There aren’t that many that get in as juniors let alone senior transfers. They may not explicitly be biased intentionally but there’s just little benefit to both parties here"

,"All throughout his speech, he kept saying “I’m probably gonna get in trouble for this”, or words to that effect. And yet, there are comments here saying that being pro-Palestine is the status quo, and that taking a pro-Israel stance is somehow “braver”??? 

If there truly is an unbiased debate, why is one side unapologetic in their views, while the other side constantly feels the need to be conciliatory?"
,"Why is everyone acting like it’s some brave position to be anti-Israel at Berkeley?

The overwhelming majority of students and faculty at Cal have been vehemently pro-Palestine…to the point that many (I know not all) have condoned or dismissed Hamas’ massacre.

Giving a speech in favor of Israel would have been an objectively braver position given the overwhelmingly anti-Zionist sentiments on campus.

Also, having listened to this speech, it’s very clear that this lecturer knows very, very little about the I/P conflict. Did anyone learn anything from this? He’s just speaking in platitudes and issuing vague statements related to “ethnic cleansing” and “genocide.” 

I know many of you don’t want to admit this, but the I/P conflict is extremely nuanced and complicated. Extremist elements on both sides (namely the illegal settlers and their far-right supporters for Israel and Islamist terror groups like Hamas and PIJ in Palestine) are standing in the way of any reconciliation talks.

There’s no easy solution to this. It will take uprooting extremist factions on both sides to take a step forward (that means Netanyahu and his coalition in addition to Hamas…which necessitates a war against Hamas)."
,What a evil creature.
,"For me there are two types of disagreements. The first is just a basic disagreement where I have a different opinion, but I can understand why someone would think differently thus it is not like I consider the other opinion ""invalid."" Assuming the other person feels the same way about my views (which is rare nowadays tbh), we can theoretically have a healthy conversation about whatever the topic is. A lot of this falls into that first category.

But then, there are other disagreements where I cannot possibly see how someone could ever think/say something like what they did, and it makes me lose respect for the individual making the claim. This falls into that second category:

> But I also do want to remind you all that the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back. That's not how it works. You don't just say, ""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?

So an organization/country that gets attacked has no right to respond? How does that work? Would Peyrin like to have Hamas continue to bomb Israel with no repercussions? Makes no sense!"
,So a bunch of rehashed social media points from someone who barely knew what Israel and Palestine a month ago.
,"The October 6 attack by Hamas killed 1500 people. Israel has a population of about 10 million.

The equivalent of an attack on the United States with a population of about 320 million would be if about 48,000 people were killed in one day.

The question is, what would you want done if say, a white nationalist group executed an attack like that on the U.S., and said they wanted to do it again, and again, and again. Sure you would want to do something. Would you still do something if somebody then claimed that you were engaging in a genocide on the white supremacists? 

>the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back

This professor believes that nothing should be done."
,I’m so proud of him! This is so well said.
,"""""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?""

That is actually exactly how that works...

Imagine if a country bombed America. We'd reduce their country to ashes."
,Ok. There are numerous pieces of misinformation in what he said here. This is absolutely irresponsible to present to your class whether or not you give a disclaimer before about how “lecture is over.”
,What a hero! Free Palestine 🇵🇸
,"Thank you for speaking up, creating a transcript, and sharing it here. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free."
,"Mr. Kao. You are brave. And, you are right - everything we do have ethical implications. From what we eat to obviously, technology."
,Too bad he won’t do the same for all those concentration camps in Xinjiang. 
,"Why does everyone feel the need to posture?  This guy is an Asian computer science teacher.  What does he know about the conflict?  Just because you read a bunch of @impact stories on Instagram doesn't mean you have the knowledge and tact necessary to speak out on this stuff.  He even admits this, confirming it is simply an egotistical posture stunt."
,"People, please understand, this is political indoctrination. He is asserting his own political view points as academic material in a technical course.

> our governments are okay with underfunding the EECS Department over and over and over again until we have no money left to support any of you. Meanwhile, it seems like every time Israel needs more bombs, they can always pull up the money that they need. How? How can that be right?

Yea, this is a political stance. ""underfunding"" according to what ? Tying in the success of an EECS student to taking a stance on Israel or Palestine is indoctrination. He should be disciplined for this.

If you want to learn about Palestine take the Palestine Decal. They present historical evidence and details and present THEIR side of the story. They do not make affirmative claims and political ideas that this guy is doing."
,is hamas a terrorist organization in your eyes?
,"I’m a member of LGBT. Gay people are legally tortured and executed in Gaza district. Despite this, I can’t help develop sympathy towards people there when I see them on TV and news. 
I condemn the genocide but not sure how to feel about the fact that they will resume killing our people again when the war is over. I wonder how one can feel the dignity and pride supporting the group of people when they wish us death during peaceful time. Normally I would keep the energy same…"
,Can someone clarify what administrative action he is facing?
,Fire his fucking ass now
,"“If you want to go, you can. But this is my last lecture…” This really implies “you should stay”. And when a professor - person with power over your future - says this, no one is really going to leave. He knew that."
,">""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?

Ironically, the peace that Kao himself enjoys comes from bombing the shit out of Japan/Germany.

I have a lot of sympathy for Palestinian civilians, but Israeli government has to do what it needs to do to protect its people from further brutalization. Hamas shares a lot of responsibility for the civilian deaths in Palestine by commingling civilian infrastructure with military."
,"It's hilarious that this clown has been spending time ""thinking about this issue."". I have friends and family who are in the thick of it.  They really don't care what he thinks or what other random Berkeley CS professors think."

,"clubs are stupid dont take it personally man do sth ur passionate about and i promise u ur gonna be fine

applying to clubs is like applying to be in a friend group.. just the concept of it is so hilariously absurd and such a turn off"
,"as someone who got rejected from every club but got 5 internship offers, the companies I interviewed with never gave a fuck about any clubs LMAO pls don't waste ur time."
,What year are you and which club is this?
,Maybe u could consult how to win friends or whatever (the book)
,"Consulting clubs do suck :(( If you want a club to connect with like-minded people and just have fun try those clubs that don’t need any sort of requirement or interviews to get in. Some of those clubs are truly amazing, I have been with a club and we do fun events and also professional development as well."
,Can someone please explain what consulting clubs are and why the hype it is? Do I need to be in a consulting club??? MechE here so do I consult? - Over exaggerating of course but I’d still like to know.
,Don’t worry about ranking and tbh they r exactly the same just party groups. Join the one you like the most.
,Just join the ones with the people you like the most. Rankings for clubs are meaningless. And consulting clubs in general do meaningless things anyway.
,Abs no company cares about the consulting clubs here
,I’d say actually practice case interviews. A lot of people just Rawdog the interview. Definitely go online and look up practice cases. Go online and really internalize all the acronyms for how to analyze companies. Practice obviously. Tbh this advice if ur gonna try hard the application. These things rlly don’t matter especially if you’re trying to do SWE. I’d also say put some business related experience on ur resume too
,"Lets see, how do you look? Physiognomy will determine it"
,"idk if this applies to all consulting clubs, but a lot of the people ik in some clubs (Voyager + Diversatech off the top of my head) have a SWE background/are actively recruiting SWE + their resumes reflect that-- i don't think its necessarily having done consulting/business/PM in the past, more just impactful experiences + the usual teamwork/leadership/etc."
,"Follow the 2 rules: 

1. Be attractive 
2. Don’t be unattractive

You think this is a joke, but I was roommates with leadership in one of these consulting clubs, and they basically said that it came down to looks (assuming that the person was somewhat eloquent and not a complete idiot)."
,too old for consulting clubs
,"The ones that do have applications are arguably the worst I’ve been in. 😵‍💫 You have sophomore students who haven’t even declared who treat you as if they went through medical school twice over, lol."
,"Check out USMO! No apps just service.

  
They can be ass but many clubs don't do much. Find transparent clubs that give you experience and are accessible. Those will help best"
,"I applied to the PMHS 2 times and didn’t get in, despite my application being good enough to get me into medical school, so that one seems pretty hard"
,definitely not as hard. the ones with competitive applications are lowk the worst ones to be in 🌚
,Be friends with the exec
,Check out Students vs Pandemics. They don’t have an application.
,Network with execs but like others said the ones with the apps are annoying
,"Welcome to Berkeley, it gets a little quieter after the second week."
,"My god, just transfer."
,That someone is you!
,"Please do not refer to Berkeley as ""UCB.""

PSA to UCSD students from the Berkeley community

Recently a meme was shared to our subeddit outlining a dismissive and disrespectful act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of.

Please do not refer to Berkeley as ""UCB."" This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. Cal, Berkeley or UC Berkeley are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. UCB, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that ""UCB"" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""UCB"" to refer our school. Thank you.

TL:DR

Don't say ""UCB"" when referring to Berkeley."
,lol. i feel u. don’t worry it will be a lot less after the first few weeks and then there are pretty much only like 6 tables left for the rest of the year.

,"How'd you talk to 100 people over the summer? How do you even start a conversation like that? What did you talk to them about? 

Asking as someone who's never really figured out what ""networking"" entails."
,"Some of these orgs will do you absolute wonders—so far as they have a healthy social scene, valuable resources, and meaningful projects that teach you something new. That being said, OP is right that our mindset around applying should be much different (if you’re thinking of applying at least)"
,"Consulting clubs are a complete joke, all they do is make you work really hard on some fake project that a company will throw away."
,"Removed until LinkedIn links have been removed from this post and comments. OP, reply back when they've been edited out."

,"Internship. Real world experience is better. Source: Manager, big 4, that interviews candidates."
,"internship without a doubt, dont listen to the ppl telling you to go with the club. you can apply to consulting clubs later down the line, and you’ll have that internship experience too. best of both worlds"
,Internship is better for career but it's unpaid so I'd consider the long term networking (+fun) from the club.
,"Most people not in the clubs don’t get the benefits of being in one. Take the club. Sky deck internships honestly don’t mean anything, a good portion of the start ups either fail or don’t amount to anything exceptional. You will have tons of opportunities to intern, and there will be more skydeck cohorts and in semester internship applications.

Benefits of the club:
- lifelong network 
- social atmosphere
- resume additions - for each semester you’re in the consulting club, you’re involved with a project which is essentially the equivalent of an internship each semester"
,How did you reach out to a skydeck company? Do they give internships to freshmen?
,I’d go with the consulting club. It will be more fun. Unpaid internships are not worth it.
,If you need income fast. Try Amazon as an Area Manager. Relatively simple hiring and the salary isn't too bad in California
,"I am sure you know this and have already done this, but if not, have you asked people for referrals? Have you asked your old startup founders for referrals? Also, your CV matters a lot at this stage. Have you gotten that reviewed from experienced people? And definitely reach out to universities or professors for research opportunities!"
,"Also, WOW on graduating from Cal with a 3.5 in EECS! You’re obviously a hard-worker and strong student! In any other market, you would’ve been snatched up in a heartbeat. For now, would it be possible to take some classes or try to earn a 2nd degree, maybe in MBA so you could pivot if need be?"
,"dw my brother was in the same situation for almost a year despite having worked at google and lots of research + hackathons etc. now he's all good working in NY, but just letting you know you're not alone in this. the hard work will be so so worth, keep pushing. i have yet to experience this, but my advice having observed this is to keep studying, practicing and reaching out to as many opportunities as possible, even places that might seem obscure but still applicable towards your education if necessary"

Overall general tip: be a contrarian. Think outside the box.

My personal quote: “If you do what everyone else is doing, by definition, your expected outcome will be average. And another word for average is mediocre.”

Grinding leetcode is a race to the bottom. Software engineering is a global workforce, and there are people just as smart or smarter around the world, wiling to work even harder than you, for less pay. Work on projects over long periods of time, to demonstrate passion and grit, not just a workhorse. Develop a unique skillset or experience that sets you apart from the rest.

You can grind gigs on Craigslist. I did that when I was early days out of college, even when I was employed—this increased my earning rate and learning/experience rate by at least 2-3x compared to my peers.

Learn to use AI and LLMs. Find gigs which can be automated, and optimize (min/max) ROI. It seems laughable on the surface, but if you can find opportunities to make $1 or $20 repeatedly, with minimal time and effort, and do this with enough frequency and volume, you can make more money than you ever will working a 9-5.

Learn business acumen. Watch YouTube for topics that will amplify your impact as SWE. Learn business and entrepreneurship.

Discipline your mind and body. Exercise regularly. Read books to level up—books are awesome—for merely $20 bucks, you can download someone’s life’s work or decades of experience, distilled into liquid gold, and absorb in a matter of hours or days, like Neo from the Matrix. I recommend Contrarian MBA: https://contrarian.mba

Pick up a hobby. Get a social group of friends. Life is too short to focus and obsess merely on one thing.

The Navy SEALs have a saying: when you’re feeling tired and exhausted, your body is actually only 40% expended. Keep pushing through and forward.

Another approach: offer to work for someone extremely influential or accomplished, that you can realistically reach within your network or 1, 2nd, 3rd degree connections, for free. Set expectations that is for a limited scope or time, and knock it out of the park. Ask them to promise a referral if they are satisfied with your work. This will typically catapult you forward by at least 5 years, if not a decade or more, of progress.

,"It's brutal out there. I've been in the tech industry for a while now - it's not your fault. There's nothing wrong with you. There's nothing you did wrong. The economy and market have changed so rapidly and it sucks that you got the short end of the stick.

So many tech companies have slashed or outright eliminated their jr swe roles. Some companies think jr engineers can be completely replaced by AI. A good chunk of hiring managers have been burned by new grad hires - they hire a jr engineer only to discover they've been completely reliant on chatgpt for the past 4 years and are unable to code. 

Be careful with recruiting firms and headhunters - the majority of them will only waste your time and some are outright scams. 

You could try applying to internships and let companies know you're okay with a 3-4 month gig. Some companies are open to hiring new grads as interns. 

My biggest piece of advice is when you apply for jobs, sort by the newest. A jr engineering role will get 1k applications within a couple of days. You want to be as high on the list as possible."

,"Have you thought about becoming an actuary? If you can pass one or two of the preliminary exams—two is ideal—gain some experience with SQL. The prem exams are generally easy for a person with a strong mathematical background such as yourself. 
From there it’s pretty easy to land a role as an actuarial analyst at an insurance company, you could start with a salary of at least $80,000.

,"Hey I'm with you there on the grueling job hunt. Considering going to Cal for their graduate programs as I had my undergrad in CS out of state, but if theres any reassurance in this, one of my friends in the bay went to UCSC and wasn't able to get a CS degree because of not being able to retake a semester (had to fly back home for her father's funeral). As unfair as it was, she continued on with a degree in Network and Digital Tech, and after a year and a half of job hunting, she landed a SWE role at Meta. There's no telling how long it'll take, but it only takes one to stick. I mean it earnestly because I needed the same sentiment too when I was in a deep rut in my job hunt 2 years ago, it's gonna work out.

,"It's gonna suck for quite awhile in technology because we cut off our nose to spite the face of the most successful sector of our economy.  Reality is your horizon for getting a good job in your major is earliest a few months after the midterms if (big if and only) Dems get control of Congress and a ""convict"" majority in the Senate.

That being statistical (but not absolute) reality, get a job outside of tech where you can leverage your education, personality, people skills.  As others have suggested, low level management at Starbucks, Peets, Wholefoods, Amazon, or the like.  The jobs usually come with medical (for you not your partner), and pay enough for a cheap apartment and a ""beater"" car.

If it's any consolation, folks in my generation had to take whatever was available when we graduated and we came out fine...a full decade later.  Things didn't really take off until the early 90's for most.

,"You may want to consider making an appointment with a substance use disorder (SUD)/addiction counselor. Your first thoughts may be that you aren't looking to completely stop using substances and/or you're not an addict, but neither of those things would disqualify you from SUD counseling. SUD counselors are trained to speak with anyone about substance use, even if it's just someone looking for more information. A competent SUD counselor will be knowledgeable about harm reduction and can work with you on responsible ways to manage your usage. If you feel pressured to immediately quit using substances, that's a failure by the counselor, not you. The primary role of a SUD counselor is to inform and support the client in making their own choices about their recovery, whether that is harm reduction or complete abstinence. Many SUD counselors have lived experience with substance use, so you may want to look specifically for someone with that experience if you think it would make you feel more comfortable.

You may also want to look into taking a course about addiction/substances at a community college. My Addiction Studies courses were taken out of state, so I don't know what's available locally, but it can provide a lot of clear information about what various substances are, how they act in your body, and what risks are associated with them.

At the end of the day, it’s your own skill and abilities that matters most, so it’s the experience that counts IMHO

,"As someone who’s been in one of the “big” consulting clubs back when I was in undergrad, just know by Senior year, I had so much stuff on my resume from doing research projects, internships, and other work (all which weren’t related in any way or form to consulting clubs) that I just omitted all the projects I did for the club. It was nice making a cool friend group while working on deliverables but you can literally make friends doing stuff for other clubs as well. 

Seriously consider research under professors. While consulting clubs are kissing ass to do a single presentation for Microsoft (with a solution rarely ever gets used), you can be getting your name on a research paper that Microsoft will actually read and apply to their business. Other pros are you can get paid or get units.

Also, like others said, you can put your heart and soul into the apps and interviews, it’s wasted effort. We spend like 5 seconds on each app and pick whoever we know or is cool (sometimes attractive 😬). It’s a like-ability interview, not a professional interview."
,"You're overestimating the opportunities you think you'll have in a consulting club. Trust me, no one with any money gives a damn what a bunch of college kids think about their field or buisness. The best thing you can do is excel in your field of study and gain expertise. If you want to get into consulting later, your credentials are going to be a lot more important than being in some random student club. Additionally, if you are serious, try to do a Summer internship or something with a firm you're interested in."
,i’m just sorry that you’ve fallen into the false notion of finance clubs having any actual prestige beyond that of a high-school level popularity angst
,"They're a waste of time, unless you're just in it for the social aspect (which, if you're trying to make friends, there are much better groups to join). Spend the hours you'd spend on useless club bullshit on getting some work and research experience under your belt. A good resume won't even have room on it for club achievements, because it should already be absolutely full of work, research, fellowships, volunteer experience, and academic achievements."
,"I got rejected from like 8 clubs my first semester and the same amt the next semester, mostly all consulting clubs. Then got rejected from all but 1 club the semester after. It was frustrating. It was hard.

Best thing I did was join a non consulting club who accepted me for who I was and the prior experience I had (resume was terrible)... the only reason to really join a club is for social life/culture/meeting ppl and you can get that in many different places so don't feel bad. Joining a consulting club doesn't define you and shouldn't be overglorified. People advertise the fun stuff but it's a lot of grunt work (I've been in a intercollegiate consulting club for a semester and left right away). And don't just gun for super popular ones, broaden your scope and look for clubs that are less exclusive or that you find interesting/fun.

Not saying consulting clubs are bad, it's just not necessary."
,"hey i get what you mean, and you're gonna be fine! if im being honest, consulting clubs are kinda the butt of a lot of jokes for good reason — many do good work, but some perpetuate this culture of exclusive access/benefit even though you can get the same skills/experiences from independent projects, research, etc! also lol i had a group interview for a consulting club earlier today and the other students interviewing were.... not rly the type of people i'd want to work with so it's kind of a mixed bag. it's unavoidable but stupid that students are placed in the position to judge other students and it's all so arbitrary considering that esp during the spring they only take a handful of people. you're not doing anything wrong at all, it's a ridiculous process :/ doing well in classes and seeking out experience through research, teaching, internships, side projects etc will net you the same personal gains, and there's lots of other communities on campus that provide groups of friends without the exclusivity culture :)"

,"For all the people hating on how selective these clubs are, when 500+ people apply to a club, wyd? Accept all of them? Accept 100? At what point does it become selective? Would you want to be in a club with hundreds of members, where you wouldn't even know more than half of the club by face? 

If anything, do what u/Junkin7 is doing and start your own club! Most of these selective clubs you guys complain about had humble beginnings, with a small community and no one trying to join. They're selective today because of the success they have found and the growth they've been through. College is all about growing yourself and you can do that by taking leadership and starting your own community!"
,"third year here... realized something was wrong about the club culture in Berkeley in freshman year when I got rejected by pbl (which I then realized was nothing of actual importance lmao)
Just find a group of good friends and do what u wanna do, definitely dont swear over this pls! Getting in Berkeley already says a lot about ur ability, dont let this get to u and ur confidence just cuz some exclusive jerks wanna make themselves feel successful and important "
,"Dw, some of the cs clubs are full of shit. I’m about to roast one of the vile ones tomorrow in my interview. "
,its ok I got rejected from all the art and fashion clubs which is significantly more embarrassing
,What's a consulting club?
,"I am so out of the loop. These days nerdy **computer clubs** get to  ""reject"" applicants like they're some popular frat or sorority?"
,Kink club welcomes you with open arms. 
,hey bro dont sweat it. I figured i might get rejected as well so i didnt even apply to any in the first place. Hmu if u tryna do shit.
,"make your own club bro, fuck em"
,Have you tried CSM? 
,You can still apply to VR@B!
,"Who cares? Fuck these clubs, they're all a scam. You think undergrads like us are incompetent in recruiting talent or potential talent; or do they just give acceptance to club on whether they know someone or how attractive a prospect might be. Clubs on this campus are a fucking joke"
,"They provide them with under-compensated worker drones and potential future fresh blood to be exploited in junior positions post-graduation.

The most useful thing they could offer are the friendships and networks built. I've noticed that various clubs on campus compete for people's free time, so it can sometimes be challenging to make strong friendships outside of these kind of circles. 
Whether this is worth it or not also depends on your field of study and goals."
,"Cal Alumni here who is currently working at a Big 4 consulting firm (and now involved in recruitment for said firm at Cal)

Another perk is that for applicants who are associated with your campus consulting club, you can get paired 1-1 with an alumni at the consulting firm for personalized coaching before your interviews. You’ll be part of a summer buddy system where we give you tailored advice at the different stages of the recruitment process and it goes a long way in your odds of getting an offer."
,"Hey! Best of luck with your applications! 🤞For purely practicing case studies, I would recommend [mbb.ai](https://mbb.ai) as it allows you to prepare without a partner and it is very beginner-friendly.Then if you want to get some theoretical background, you can also read Case in Point or other online resources on websites like PrepLounge.Hope that helps!"
,"Our club changes apps every semester. One quick tip: don’t apply just to apply. Do your research, figure out which groups you’d actually WANT to join/see a good fit in, and prioritize your apps that way. You’ll be fine lol just chill until school starts"
,I’m starting a consulting business to help students get into consulting clubs on campus. DM if interested
,UEA Consulting was a joke tbh
,"UEA consulting is a joke, no real preparation only advantage would be using it to join and network with a better consulting club and apply for that next semester."
,They make you write essays for these things? Just don’t waste your time with this (I guess you already did though so sunk cost).
,Attend the coffee chats to boost your chances
,"Defo a target school and joining clubs isn't a must but is a huge advantage. Consulting clubs with empathetic, effective leadership and healthy club culture won't mind that you're a transfer. Feel free to PM me to chat!"
,"Consulting firms thrive on diversity so your major/non-Haas shouldn't matter at all. And if you do sufficient case prep, and behavioral interview practice you should have a shot. The clubs are helpful in providing a structured environment but they are neither necessary or sufficient."
,"As someone fairly familiar with the business club community at Berkeley, I’ll try to give an honest take on the different clubs you’ve mentioned:  
BC -  BC is the oldest and arguably the most established consulting club at Berkeley. They usually get a pretty good range of clients and quality of their work is arguably the best, in addition to their professional development.  
Voyager - I hear a lot about Voyager mostly from their members who always seem to be talking about their social culture. They seem to be very tight knit as a group and have a lot of fun but also seem to net a range of big-name projects each semester. Placement also seems solid.  
CBA - CBA is actually AKPsi rebranded (they were called the Tremaine Group last semester and rebranded this semester), don’t know too much about their specifics but they seem to have really good professional placements, but they did go underground for a bit because of hazing.   
UFA - This club is more focused on finance afaik, but from all I’ve heard they have a top-notch reputation for finance and in terms of placement  
BAP - BAP one of the few business frats on campus that have not been forced to rebrand - heard good things about them overall but don’t know too much about the specifics  
Some other clubs worth looking into:  
NIB, BEACN and TBG are some other clubs worth looking into if you’re more into the social impact side of consulting  
Venture, UpSync, and DiversaTech are also consulting clubs that are more tech oriented instead of being more generalist, with Venture specializing more in startups  
Honestly though, none of these clubs are worth stressing that much about - best advice is probably just to go to some of the info sessions or sign up for some of the coffee chats to get a feel for the members and to see if you can envision yourself getting along and having a good time with the people in the club and going based on gut feel from there"
,"Big difference is that consulting clubs like Voyager will have you working on projects directly for top companies, which can give you a leg up in work experience, while business frats/groups like BAP center on their training/development programs. Voyager and BAP are full of bing chillers though, highly recommend."
,"Im an alum now, but here’s some advice that I wish I had followed: 
1) First, decide how badly you want to join these types of organizations. I mean really do a good introspective look.
2) If you dont get in first time, try again.

I tried once and it didnt go well. Then I never tried again. Looking back, I realized how fun some of these clubs looked and now regret it. Good luck kid"
,"As a graduating senior going into my full-time PM role soon, I'd like to say that I understand Berkeley Business pretty well. I'd like to start off by saying that all of these orgs are solid choices, and that they are all worth joining if you get in. However, there are major differences that I will break down:

  
BC -- BC is the oldest and most established, however of the consulting clubs, it is the most intense and requires the most time commitment. Think 20-25 hour weeks consistently for your first semester. They have a lot of quants, swe people and source excellent projects, but it is definitely a more competitive and intense environment.

  
CBA -- Simply put, best professional development on campus. They have the most McKinsey, Bain, and BCG placements of any campus org, and place nearly everyone they take into top IB groups. That being said, they are not a consulting club but often do consulting projects. However, they are not a consulting club, so if you are certain that you want a focus on serious consulting projects, you are better off joining Voyager, BC, BBS, etc. Believe they are founded by some old AKPsi members.

  
Voyager – Like a slightly less professional and more social version of BC. They still recruit very well, however, they are less intense and require a slightly lower time commitment. Think 15 hour weeks or less. Their job placement is good as well, so can't really go wrong with them.

  
BAP -- A fraternal Greek version of CBA, that recruits well into finance but less so into consulting. They are the only real business fraternity on campus, so they do have that greek pledging aspect that is very intense. However, the pledging does bring the org close together! You go to BAP if you want the Greek pledging experience, whereas you go to CBA if you want the professional placements in a more traditional but social environment.

  
UFA/UMCG -- basically a network for consultants and bankers. Solely professional development, so a great way to make connections with a low time commitment. Would not rely on it as a primary org, but if you get in, undoubtedly worth joining. 

Good luck and you'll be fine wherever you get in!"
,"As a first-year at Cal, I’ve taken the liberty to go around and see past general campus sentiment and into some of the real aspects of these clubs, and what you’ll gain, besides the name. If you’re looking for community, professional resources, and connections helpful for recruiting, you cannot go wrong with CBA or BAP. Obviously, consulting clubs like BBS, Voyager and BC may more to offer in terms of consulting projects themselves, but both CBA and BAP are filled with people from the best consulting/finance clubs all around campus (NIB, CMG, BBS, BC, UFA, etc) including people with leadership positions there. Banking/consulting recruiting, as I think someone else in this thread mentioned, is also unparalleled from groups such as CBA/BAP, because clubs centered on consulting projects don’t put as much stress on recruiting, and more so towards doing the projects themselves. BAP, however is the only “Greek” business org on campus tho, so if you’re looking for a traditional pledging experience you might enjoy your time there. CBA seems to have more focus on professional development, though, as they have less of a Greek identity, despite their high membership base of ex-AKPsi members. Anyhow, dont forget that you can always join more than one org though throughout undergrad, so don’t stress to much about making a single pick right now as I did during my first semester."
,heard CBA is pushin 🅿️

,Really don’t recommend valley consulting. Had a terrible experience and their process is extremely questionable.
,"I've heard good things about the culture in TBG, NIB, Voyager, Upsync"
,"DiversaTech! We have none of the toxic stuff that goes on elsewhere, and the community here has the most warm and welcoming people. All that + our projects are super interesting and fulfilling. Learn more at [https://www.diversatech.org/apply](https://www.diversatech.org/apply), schedule a 1-on-1 with one of us, and come to our infosession on Tuesday at 8pm!"
,"whatever you do, avoid NIB!! allegedly they make all of their final round applicants swallow a goldfish to become members… weird shit dude :-/"
,Y’all get interviews for these consulting clubs 🥲
,"Super solid question, honestly; I had the same concerns when I was looking around too. Personally I chose [Venture](https://www.berkeleyvss.com/), for two main reasons: 

1) everyone I talked to were homies and were good people and not just in it for the professional stuff, but also were super down to help you with resume or recruiting, or just learning business things (rather than expecting you to come in with that sort of background). The new member training atmosphere was really about helping you from whatever starting point you were at and bringing you up from there, whether you're a super poppin eecs boi, pre-haas, or literally anything else with a diff degree of exp.  


2) I think the type of work that we do also lends itself to a more non-toxic environment. Because we work only with startups rather than chonky companies, you trade the name recognition for work with higher level management that can be super fulfilling. Compared to other clubs, I've noticed that people aren't as toxic or unwelcoming as elsewhere because they tend to have a different mindset, and aren't driven just by having a super clout company name on their resume or something.  


I've been with Venture for two years at this point and it's really helped me, so feel free to DM me with other questions or check out this other [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ib2wuw/businessconsulting_clubs_advice_pls/g1wd335/?context=3) from an older reddit post that may help :)"
,Any class that pads your GPA.
,"For general consulting yeah there's no one-stop shop just bc of how varied the profession can be, otherwise theyd only hire Haas. That being said, in my experience, there's some classes that focus on specific skills that could help [im not familiar with Econ tho]

- classes with a major group project, esp if it's with an actual company: IEOR 115 (database), IEOR 135 (venturex)


- classes teaching hard skills that could always help to have familiarity with (excel, databases, pandas): UGBA 104/147 (excel), IEOR 115 (basic SQL, databases), D100 (SQL, pandas, technical projects)


- *less important, but good skills to have if you want to be more technical than the general rando*: IEOR 142/D144 (data analytics, basic ML, python, statsmodels), D101 (data eng, balance btwn IEOR 115 and CS 186), INFO 159 (NLP, but good overview of common neural networks to have familiarity)"
,"The three consulting clubs known for being the most prestigious and selective are BC, TBG, and NIB because they are the 3 oldest consulting clubs on campus. This also means that these 3 consulting clubs have the largest alumni network, institutional knowledge, and general clout and brand awareness.

Here’s a break down of the Big 3 (they call themselves TriCon): 
1.	⁠BC - BC is hands down most prestigious and take on the biggest name clients and are paid $$$ for their work. That being said it’s common for people to put in up to 20+ hours on consulting work for BC. But this also does mean you get really close with your team and the rest of the club. Some of the members are pretty fun, but most are very academic and scholarly. This also means though that they have a few superstars & their job placement at MBB and big banks is always good. TLDR: Can be a lot of work and some play, but best for professional development and clout.
2.	⁠TBG - TBG is the second oldest consulting club on campus and works exclusively with nonprofits. Their whole thing is that members are passionate about the social sector. Overall though, TBG folks are generally pretty chill & fun. Do know that they don’t work with huge name clients. However, TBG claims that working with nonprofits helps set you apart to job recruiters and on your Haas app. Take that as you will. But TBG does have a pretty consistent MBB/Banking/tech pipeline and a lot of Haas folks. TLDR: Smart, down to earth folks who have fun & have solid professional development. 
3.	⁠NIB - NIB is known for being the more casual and chill younger sibling of TBG and BC. They do a range of projects from  nonprofits, for-profits, and socially responsible businesses. They’re known to be the nicest and least buttoned up of the three consulting clubs. Also place pretty well professionally and are just generally well-rounded people. They won’t be the most brilliant people you meet at Berkeley, but they’re nice and fun to be around. TLDR: Wholesome & nice, wide range of projects. Also decent professional development.

Other consulting clubs that are awesome if you have a specific niche are Phoenix (Healthcare), Venture/Valley (Tech), BEACN (Environment) or imagiCal (Marketing). I would highly recommend these clubs if you know there is a specific niche you are interested in because BC, TBG, and NIB source different projects every semester so you’re not guaranteed something in your niche.

Consulting clubs I would absolutely avoid are BBS and CYC. They’re basically knock off versions of BC, TBG, and NIB, but they have 10x the ego and there are also a lot of rumors of foul play & drama. They’ll draw you in with the fancy events & brand name sponsors, but these people are peak Haas-holes.

At the end of the day, all consulting clubs are pretty pretentious, and you will succeed with or without them because you’re already at Berkelely. Obviously take all advice (including mine) with a grain of salt, and just try to meet as many people as possible. Trust your gut, and you will find your place. Go bears!"
,"pro-bono: tbg

tech: valley

startups: venture

oldest/alumni network: bc

social impact: nib"
,"If you’re dead set on applying to these pre-professional clubs, apply to them as you would colleges—a few newer ones, a couple well established ones, a couple highly selective ones

Fundamentally they’re all the same"
,"I’m pretty sure the three oldest and most prestigious are Berkeley Consulting, Net Impact, and th Berkeley Group. Each one is pretty difficult to get into. Best of luck!"
,biased but I would definitely recommend DiversaTech if you’re interested in tech or design in addition to business consulting. come chat with us on sproul next week!
,"TBG, BC, NIB are top three on campus, personally i've heard the best things about TBG.. i went to an infosession last semester and the members were super cool and genuinely passionate about their work"
,"some good ones would be berkeley consulting, net impact, the berkeley group, voyager, cmg, and aba"

,Can students not attending cal but another uc join?
,What type of consulting are you registered for under the  ASUC? Startup? I feel Ike someone already does that
,"Voyager has some pretty awesome technical work. Stuff I got to do in the last year: economic modeling for illicit goods, learning clustering/classification techniques for huge customer datasets, build a backend and frontend for custom pricing software. Really good rewarding work to decking ratio."
,"Apply to diversatech! Every semester we have projects that are both business- and technical-focused, and our community and socials are super fun. Our application + coffee chats are open @ https://www.diversatech.org/apply"
,"Personally I'm in venture and would say that esp as of late wqe do have a good mix of business and technical projects if you wanted to go that route (although not a requirement if you wanted to diversify your skillset). Working with startups means that we have a lot of flexibility with the types of projects that we can take on compared to if we were working with a massive company, so we're able to tailor our work to what the specific members on the project want to learn. If you're on a project and would want to do some optimization of delivery routes for a food delivery company, or some data analysis to understand customer pain points, you'd be able to talk with your PM to set that up. It's def going to be less technical than a pure 'core tech' club, but i'd argue that the flexibility of mixing tech and business however you want could be something to consider when looking around. I've written a few comments abt venture over the years so check my post history or DM me with questions :)"
,Imo a lot of the more embedded systems-y clubs have way cooler and fun projects if you’re interested at all on that side of things.
,It sounds like you’re an upperclassman since you did a  lot of internships. Most of these major consulting clubs bring in lowerclassmen because they want them to grow and become the next leaders of their clubs.
,"To all the concerned underclassmen reading, I'm pretty sure this is satire. Google APM Intern applications don't even open until Sept 8th. Def don't need 4/5 FAANG internships just to get an interview for a consulting club lol."
,"You don’t need consulting clubs like these tbh. It seems like you are already and amazing student/worker by your experiences and not getting an interview def doesn’t speak to you or your work ethic in any sense. If your goal was to meet people, look into other clubs that are more open to others and less competitive (I’ve heard some people want to leave consulting clubs after their first semester due to burnout and whatnot too)"
,"Off topic, but any tips for someone looking to get my first CS internship this summer"
,"Many clubs do not take upperclassmen (even junior transfers) because they are looking for sustained, long-term commitment in their club. Because of this, you were probably rejected on a semi-auto drop basis"
,Yo what's consulting?
,Hi I am doing case practice please schedule here https://calendly.com/raymondalbuero/management-consulting-case-interview.
,I’m interested! Dm me if you are still looking!
,What a weird problem.
,Lol just shitpost and tell everybody bullshit and then proceed to get promoted to president
,"Not worth it tbh. I was in a consulting club my freshman year that wasn’t in my major and by the second semester I left. The sheer amount of work for what’s already very minimal gain is hard enough to justify on its own. I’d take that extra time you get to put into classes, research/internships/ and socializing vs joining a cult that doesn’t benefit you individually."
,"if you have the hours for it might as well try it out for a semester and see if you vibe with the people there, but I’d put it at bottom priority if it looks like there’s other things competing for your time"
,"The whole point of a club (and college experience in general I guess) is to figure out what you like and don't like. If you think consulting is a possible career path, then go for it. Surely there must be reason that you applied in the first place."
,Focus on gaining some experience outside of school bro. Fuck them clubs.
,Any company that hires based on being in one of these clubs will have a work place at least as toxic as you would think
,"Buck up.  You'd be far better off getting a real part time (summer?) job, any job will do."
,“They need you more than you need them”
,Me too it kinda hurt
,Hey . Pm me . Hablo español amiga
,"You might know this one then, what *is* consulting?"
,"Hey there, just went through the other side of this - read and interviewed a ton of applicants last weekend so happy to share insights as well."
,Hi! I went through all the interview rounds but I got rejected at the social round. Doesn't really make sense to me. Any insights?
,Start your own if you really want to be one of these toxic clubs. There are no shortage of consulting rejects eager to pounce on any modicum of prestige and appearances to climb the social ladder
,"Tailor it to the club as much as possible. We can tell when you submitted one that was also written for another club. Proofread and be sure you did not write another club's name. If you do, it's an auto-rejection."
,"Do mushrooms with a witchy chick (or whatever gender identity, as long as it's witchy) in the woods and reevaluate your priorities?"
