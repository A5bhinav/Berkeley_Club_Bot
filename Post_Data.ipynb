      " - Hey guys! I am super excited to come to Berkeley in the fall and I heard that joining clubs is a great way to get involved. I applied here as Econ and I’m really curious about consulting clubs, but there are an overwhelming amount of options. The more I look at Reddit the more confused I get haha (why is it so deep??). I’ve seen some “ranking” posts that put some clubs over others, but I wanted some more information from current students about what these clubs actually are and how they are different. Any insights will be extremely helpful so I can get a sense of what I want to apply to, thank you!\n",
