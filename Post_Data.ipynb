Now, however, I kinda realize that my social circle/network isn't very big and I honestly want to meet more people involved with tech, and have a better overall social scene.\n",

Currently I'm thinking about Valley, Venture, and Voyager for consulting and Launchpad, ML@B, Blockchain and Codebase(although I'd prefer not just doing full stack stuff) for core tech.\n",

      " - Hey guys! I am super excited to come to Berkeley in the fall and I heard that joining clubs is a great way to get involved. I applied here as Econ and I’m really curious about consulting clubs, but there are an overwhelming amount of options. The more I look at Reddit the more confused I get haha (why is it so deep??). I’ve seen some “ranking” posts that put some clubs over others, but I wanted some more information from current students about what these clubs actually are and how they are different. Any insights will be extremely helpful so I can get a sense of what I want to apply to, thank you!\n",
      " - Hi, I’m a freshman interested in applying to consulting clubs this semester. But…I’m a bit overwhelmed by the number of consulting clubs I’ve found just from searching the club list. Does anyone have any recommendations for which clubs are best? Or just some advice in general? I’ve also heard of some consulting clubs like Berkeley Consulting and Net Impact that are supposed to be pretty difficult to get into so Im a bit nervous about the process. Thank you in advance!\n",
      " - I am a freshman at Berkeley studying Economics and hopefully Data Science. I know people say not to worry about consulting clubs on campus because they're so competitive, but I really want to try my hand at it at least once. My only issue is that all of the infosessions for every single club seem to overlap next week. I initially wanted to go to the \"top\" clubs like Berkeley Consulting and Berkeley Business Society, but some of my upperclassman friends have been saying that they fell off and that clubs like Voyager Consulting are now more respected than them? I don't get it what is the lore? And I know there are other clubs like Net Impact Berkeley, Venture Strategy Solutions, etc., but which ones would actually be worth my time applying to and attending infosessions for?\n",
      " - I'm a freshman this year at Berkeley and was just wondering which consulting clubs are known to be the best ones bc there's way too many of them and I wanna figure out which infosessions to go to.

      "\n",
      "1. **Genuinely impressive projects**: Many successful consultants start with smaller projects or initiatives that demonstrate their capabilities and values.\n",
      "2. **Strong internship experience**: If you're interested in a particular club, try to highlight any relevant internships or work experiences on your application.\n",
      "3. **Networking**: Attend club info sessions, join clubs, and connect with current members to build relationships and learn more about the opportunities available.\n",
      "4. **Demonstrate skills and knowledge**: Show potential for consulting skills by highlighting transferable courses, projects, or research in computer science.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get into these clubs, you'll typically need:\n",
      "\n",
      "* A strong undergraduate GPA (usually 3.5+)\n",
      "* Relevant coursework, such as:\n",
      "\t+ Computer programming\n",
      "\t+ Data structures\n",
      "\t+ Algorithms\n",
      "\t+ Machine learning\n",

      "\t+ PowerPoint\n",
      "\t+ Word processing software\n",
      "\t+ Online collaboration platforms\n",

      "* Prepare a strong resume and cover letter that highlights relevant skills and experience.\n",
