      " - Over the past month on this subreddit there have been numerous posts about alienation from minority folk that I resonate with as one myself and I'd like to share my own experiences in regards to consulting club culture.\n",

      "I think most people see through the bs of the image of meritocracy of the application process these clubs pretend to have. People know you're being judged by students who are 1-2 years older than you, and that 'vibes' are the main thing. The application process is akin to rushing a frat/sorority, but I'd like to wager within this realm of 'club vibes' is legit just discrimination based off color that even frats/sorority don't have. Look, I understand that a majority of rushees are white and thus it makes sense if greek life is majority white, but there still exists members of other races. Likewise, the majority of consulting club applicants are asian, but there's a very VERY noticable monolothic type of member that gets accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked a couple of clubs during tabling about their DEI, and pointed out my observation of their inclusiveness. I've very literally been hit with: 'we see this as an issue' and 'it's because of inherit biases that people gravitate towards others who look like them'. Needless to say I felt estranged even after the info sessions where you have an opportunity to talk to the members. Out of the ten or so clubs I applied to I made it through two first rounds but didn't get accepted to any in the end.\n",
