      " - PLEASE DO THIS!!! I'm a freshman and I was literally trying to find a club on campus so please please do this please.\n",
      " - I applied to a very large number of data science and tech clubs this semester and eventually got rejected from all of them. I’m kind of sad about it especially as I had made it to the final round of my favorite club but fumbled the behavioral interview due to nerves, but I’m also trying to be proactive and see if I can make the semester even better than if I had joined the club. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I really wanted out of the club was the social / community aspect of it and the technical skills development portion of it, and I don’t really need to be in a mega-competitive club to fulfill these things. The second one I can definitely achieve on my own this semester as I have some personal projects I’d love to work on and I can totally self-learn a lot of things, so I’m mostly looking for fun clubs with a lot of social opportunities and no or minimal application.\n",
