      "Error embedding: Miss out on a consulting club this semester? I recently graduated from Cal and was a member of a consulting club, but a lot of my closest friends were in non-business orgs. Looking back, I realized they often had a much healthier balance: friendlier communities, lower time commitments, and (surprisingly often) solid career outcomes too. So I wanted to share some honest thoughts on those clubs from what I’ve heard — the ones that still have applications, but are much easier to join and a lot less intense than consulting or finance orgs. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Most importantly, most of the clubs in this list still have applications open as of today!**\n",
      "\n",
      "# Engineering and STEM\n",
      "\n",
      "**Space Exploration @ Berkeley (SEB)** – Members are insanely talented and dedicated. Every semester they design and launch liquid-fueled rockets in the desert, with the long-term goal of reaching the Kármán Line (the edge of space). Has a bunch of departments covering engineering and non-engineering work (sponsors, publicity, etc.). Almost all the upperclassmen have NASA, SpaceX, or defense contractor internships. Not the biggest party club, but everyone seems genuinely great.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Formula Electric @ Berkeley** – Lower time commitment compared to SEB, with departments for building, racing, and marketing an electric-powered race car. Stronger party culture, fun members, and cool merch.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Pre-Law\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Berkeley Forum** – Student-run org that brings famous speakers to campus (Dylan O’Brien, Anthony Fauci, Jaylen Brown, Peter Thiel). Surprisingly strong placement across finance, law, and tech (they send a few people to Goldman, McKinsey, FAANG, JPM each year). Members are close, with different committees to apply to, a reasonable time commitment (4–6 hrs/week), and a strong social culture with retreats and plenty of socials. Straightforward application open to all majors and interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "**ASUC Student Advocate's Office -** ASUC branch that helps students navigate financial aid, discrimination, academic dishonesty complaints, etc. All the members are very close, lots of club spirit, and friendly competition between committees makes for a fun experience. Anyone can apply for leadership, and the work feels genuinely impactful. Parties semi-frequently, usually pretty fire. App passed for this fall, but will recruit again in the Spring. \\~7hrs/week time commitment, my friend in the club raves about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Arts & Entertainment\n",
      "\n",
      "**CALX** – Over 200 members run Berkeley’s radio station. Departments include special events, radio archives, music curation, publicity, and more. Less tight-knit because of the size, but they throw big parties and socials. No app required, just show up to intro meetings and put in a few hours a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "**SUPERB** – The entertainment branch of ASUC. They host free concerts, movie screenings, game nights, and other events for all students. Don’t know anyone in it personally, but it looks like a blast for people into music, cinema, or arts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**BAMPFA Student Committee** – Works with BAMPFA to get students involved with events like poster galleries, film exhibitions, opening nights, and art festivals. Full of art/film lovers. You can apply to different departments like marketing, film, or art curation.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Volunteering\n",
      "\n",
      "**Habitat for Humanity** – Huge club of volunteers. Not the most social unless you’re on exec, but they put effort into making meetings fun (skits, pranks, etc.). Leadership is solid and from all kinds of majors. Hard to track placements since most members join casually.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Berkeley FeelGood Club** – Volunteers make grilled cheese sandwiches on Sproul, with proceeds going to Feeding America. Low commitment, fun vibe. Each semester, execs get an all-expenses-paid trip to Feeding America’s NYC conference. No application—just show up.\n",
      "\n",
      "**BEAM** – STEM-heavy club where students teach local elementary and middle schoolers. Very wholesome, filled with kind and sharp people who genuinely care. Apps for this semester just closed (Sept 5), but they recruit every term.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Other\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Environmentalist Magazine** – For students interested in nature + journalism. Student-run magazine that produces 1-2 online issues per semester. Has different departments for art, photo, design, about 40 members total. Relatively new, but seems to have a good amount of socials like hiking trips, cookouts. Good exposure and practical reporting experience in a social group with low time commitment. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Caravan Magazine** – Travels each semester to a new city to document and write pieces for their magazine. Small and very competitive, but that makes the group extremely close.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Berkeley Coffee Club** – Upperclassman-heavy club of coffee fanatics. They check out cafes weekly and sometimes host free tastings with their own brews. Low commitment, mostly just feels like a big group of friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Poker @ Berkeley** – Hosts weekly poker nights with low-to-mid buy-ins and also runs the Poker decal. Chill way to meet new people, with a lot of overlap with business clubs and frats.\n",

      "Error embedding: Club culture is really intense and scary, especially for new students entering such a big campus like Cal. Clubs, specifically those in finance and consulting, get a bad reputation for being so selective and elitist. Some for very good reasons, and some for no reason at all. After speaking with many friends who became involved with finance organizations, professional fraternities, and strategy consulting clubs, we realized how much they transformed our experiences and professional outcomes. Although that was our personal experience, we realized that some were hesitant given polarized opinions, which this guide aims to clear up.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a more personal note, club recruiting is extremely mystified in my opinion at Cal. It's summed up by the quote \"Those who know don't speak. Those who speak don't know\". When students get bombarded at tabling with tens of hundreds of club sales pitches, it is hard to separate fact from fiction (especially when all that is publicized are such extreme takes). In my opinion, there are very few out there that are willing to have authenticity with transfers or freshmen especially who come to Cal wide eyed, so I wanted to share insights I've gathered in hopes of helping those students.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "# Disclaimers (please read):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. As many people argue, you definitely **do not need to join a student organization** to have a great experience at Cal. Some choose to focus on classes and their GPA, pursue academic research, pursue professional roles directly, or a combination of all of them. It is evident that some students inflate business-oriented clubs to be a necessity, but my friends and I know so many others who are not in professional clubs that still have great experiences at Cal and reach their professional goals. Affinity groups, religious organizations, greek life, and other niche interest groups are a great way to meet great friends, have a great time in college, and reach your professional goals. *You can create your own path here. Everyone else's path doesn't have to mold you.*\n",
      "2. However, saying that these organizations **WON'T** make it easier for you to reach certain professional business goals (mainly within high finance/consulting) **is most likely inaccurate**. Some alumni in these clubs go back 20 years and have pursued every career in finance, investing, entrepreneurship, consulting, etc. There undoubtedly is **a higher concentration** of alumni who have attained **professional success**, which naturally makes it easier for members to replicate. Things like mentorship, compiled resources, and the preferential treatment from alumni can help in essentially any role (apart from any post-graduate schooling). It may or may not be true that \"you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with\", but it's likely the case that the people you spend the most time with have the *highest probability of affecting you the most*.\n",
      "3. This list mainly gives **opinions** on prestige and placements, but it also aims to show a laundry list of possible options that might make it easier to learn about these clubs rather than going down rows of tents each semester. Clubs at the top may be more \"successful\", but that *does not mean in any regard that you can't find success in any of the other clubs*. Conversely, it also means that clubs at the top do not guarantee any degree of higher success.\n",
      "4. Other lists go into approximate acceptance rates, but these guesses are unfounded and hard to standardize. Most clubs take 10-12 kids a semester, with most around 6-10, *which already is less than 10%* if 100 people apply, which is almost certain given Berkeley's population. Taking devil's advocate, **it is important for clubs on campus to stay relatively small**, as that is exactly why they make the experiences of their members and why they are tight-knit. At the end of the day, just know you can find this experience in *so many clubs*, that even if acceptance rates are low, **any one club can equally be great for you**. Lower acceptance rates may mean more prestige, but that does not mean higher acceptance rate clubs can't help you reach success.\n",
      "5. The issue of racial demographics within clubs listed **may be out of the control of the clubs**. A vast majority of these clubs tend to have CS, DS, EECS, Math, Econ, and Business majors, as those majors tend to be interested in the work these clubs do. Not only is Berkeley's population *disproportionately* Asian, but those Asians even more *disproportionately* make up the majors above. Applicants that tend to be interested in these clubs thus tend to be extremely *disproportionately* Asian. The issue is greater than just members trying to pick their own, with many **clubs largely trying to make as diverse classes** as possible, but failing given the amount of Asians that are interested and qualified. What is unfortunate and wrong is that **many clubs refuse to take juniors or older students** given that they want to \"invest\" in members that can \"contribute\" for as long as possible, which is genuinely terrible and discriminatory. However, some organizations are more welcoming and I will try to highlight those that are below.\n",
      "6. Finally, I will **only be mentioning business organizations**. It's really hard to draw parallels between business and finance oriented clubs to tech clubs who have different objectives and target different students, so for the purpose of standardization, clubs mentioned will have at least some strategy consulting arm, professional/business help objective, or investing objective.\n",

Take on Fortune 500 clients, and have lots in tech and tech clubs (ML@B members specifically), but have probably the best  placements in quant and finance, though results can vary.

They have direct pipelines to Goldman Sachs' TMT office in SF and an alumni network that is practically unparalleled. Their pledge process definitely leaves members traumatized and causes social culture to be extremely toxic, but also results in the members that choose to be involved, really active, and form their only social circles within the club.

Their pledge process is not on any level near the big 3 business fraternities listed above (i.e. wet or with extreme tasks), but still is effort. Generates solid revenue from their consulting arm, ZC Consulting, allowing them to go on international trips every so often. Culture is definitely less toxic than the others, and is known to take juniors and junior transfers as well which is a good sign of inclusion.\n",

Notably does consulting on the side like PSE and runs a really big startup event with venture capitalists in the area, but are a more mix of a social fraternity given ties to other south asian organizations and also given social parties and events that they host as well.

Student-run hedge fund that creates investment pitches in public equities with over $140k in assets (provided through alumni donations). Has a rigorous and extensive education process for first semester new members with return offers given depending on the quality of work, which results in members that are really knowledgeable but more socially absent. Has relationships with Point72 and Citadel and consistently sends members there along with other extremely prestigious banks and hedge funds mainly. Many members as of recently come from professional fraternities, but the interview process is still extremely meritocratic however given that the initial application is a fully anonymous stock pitch.\n",

Has a rigorous education process as well with return offers on the line for entrance into the club, and elite placements in finance across the board given the rigor of that education and similar relationships with Point72 and Citadel. More socially tight knit compared to BIG with their interview process prioritizing for fit and willingness to learn rather than pure investing ability, and has more internal and cross club social events. Notably has a Quant division with members educated in the technical side of investing that has a track record of producing many quant developers and software engineers.\n",

      "If you have read through all 54 of these clubs, you probably can tell that these clubs **don't have that many differences at all** which is why there is no point for a lot of people to stress about them unless you desire something that only a specific club has (e.g. industry focus, alumni network, placements at certain firms, type of work). There is no better way to truly learn about your fit other than talking to the members and asking them questions directly. *Only you will know what you truly like!*\n",

      "\n",
      "Club recruitment may seem trivial (because it is), but joining the right club can make or break the type of friend group you form, the parties you are invited to, and even the internships/job you attain.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you feel lost or confused by the club scene, know that you’re not alone. Sproul Plaza always crawls with undifferentiated club salespeople screaming, “interested in \\_\\_\\_?” I remember thinking, “what the f\\*\\*\\* are consulting clubs?” Many of my floormates, however, came from Bay Area feeder schools (MSJHS, Paly, Saratoga, Lynbrook, etc.) and inherited an army of helpful upperclassmen that guided them through club recruitment. They freely received valuable advice I felt was hard to come by. This ranged from which clubs to target to what interview questions to expect. Although I eventually found my footing, I can confidently say the odds were stacked against me and will be the same for many of you. So I write this in hopes of (slightly) uplifting any fellow underdogs out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were to run the gauntlet again, some of the criteria I would evaluate clubs via:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Achievement**: How well do members recruit professionally, and what fields do they recruit best for? Sure, fulltime recruiting is largely an individual pursuit. But if a club consistently recruits well, that may indicate hard-working and professionally oriented members, a robust network that aided them in that journey, and a structured mentorship program to get you off the ground. If that matters to you, of course.\n",
      "* **Commitment**: What is the club’s expected time commitment on a weekly basis? The standard is generally 10 hours/week, although this can vary significantly.\n",
      "* **Culture**: How strong is the club’s internal culture? Every club will say their culture is strong. But to cut through the noise, the best proxy is an average members’ tenure. People vote with their feet, and if members truly care about the club, they stick around in meaningful roles. You’ll see clubs with sophomores (or even freshmen!) in leadership, and that is a huge red flag. That means juniors or seniors don’t give a crap and jump ship to focus on other endeavors. If a club’s juniors/seniors show up to events and are running the club, that means they still have a lot to learn/gain, or they just genuinely enjoy being there.\n",
      "* **Development**: Will you learn a lot and get to work on interesting projects? And how well does the club train and develop its members professionally? This may come in the form of external consulting projects, structured development workshops, etc.\n",
      "* **Diversity**: How diverse is the academic, ethnic, and professional makeup of the club? This rating will be relative to other clubs, given the disproportionate Asian & Business Major representation in the community. This may be the hardest to pin down accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The broader club landscape and my ratings:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Business Frats**: I cannot, in good faith, recommend you join a business frat. The pledging process – the process of joining – can be emotionally, verbally, and/or physically abusive. Unless you 100% want to pursue finance, I would advise against business frats.\n",

      "Last year, Mobile Developers of Berkeley was ranked 10th, as survey respondents claimed the club was socially dead, had lost focus, and many had left. There was some improvement in the first half of the year, but that improvement came at the cost of spending most of their saved money on socials, leading to a significant decline in the second half of the year. While they will probably exist for a while longer, it's clear that MDB needs change if they're going to regain the status they have had in the past. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that most people in the club don't actually want to do mobile development, but they've lost a lot of the interest of their members that they had in years past.\n",

Their culture leaves something to be desired - certainly they have cool events and trips to Hawaii, but most of the members aren't truly committed the same way that they are to some other clubs. Their ratio of active members to people who are in the club just for the socials is fairly low, meaning that their budget might not be as sustainable as that of some other clubs. But PlexTech is a pretty new club, and they've been making a lot of progress since 2022, when they weren't even on the list.

It doesn't hurt that they have gotten some well-known clients and have been able to afford some pretty fun events (retreats, yachts, etc). Overall, they have good vibes and I definitely see them moving up even farther in the future. They're also among the largest clubs on this list with around 100 members, which makes them a good test case to see if clubs this big can really form the same community as smaller clubs like the ones that make up most of the top 5.\n",

They continue to host parties, they definitely posted the link to my survey in their club chat and got a bunch of people to rate them really high, and their members continue to be active within the club. But on other fronts, the WDB experience has gotten worse since last year. Their culture was described last year by one person as \"work hard, play hard,\" but now they seem to just be \"play hard,\" which has impacted their budget and general environment. They have a pretty strong big-little program (mentioned by more than one person), and people don't seem to be leaving yet, but it's unclear whether they can maintain this culture in the future, given the lack of interest in actually doing web development.\n",

But they haven't quite attained the same social culture that some of the top clubs, and even the up-and-comers have.

There are more cliques now than there used to be, and the club tends to have a very specific culture that it's great if you fit in with, but unfortunately, not everyone fits in. The professional experience is strong if you want it to be, and Launchpad is a great place for a specific kind of person.

Codebase is still the prototypical Berkeley tech club - generic name, incredibly low acceptance rate, pretentious-sounding website - but they've improved their social experience a decent amount since last year while getting rid of the strange crypto projects and replacing them with legitimate projects (that pay quite a lot of money). Codebase remains one of the top clubs at Berkeley, though there are still concerns. They often try to cut potential members off from other clubs - they've tried to give \"exploding offers\" in the past, as well as enforce that new members can't join any other clubs in the same semester. If you join Codebase, it's harder to slack off than in a lot of other clubs - they get a lot of money because they are doing the work for it. If you want to work hard, but get rewarded for it, Codebase is a good place for you.\n",

And it makes sense - people who join Blueprint, a club about creating tech for non-profits, are generally interested in helping out the world. They might not have the largest budget, because they do pro bono work, but if you want to join a community, not just go to Hawaii, Blueprint is a great choice. They've even established chapters across the nation, which is not something that an unstable club would do. It's very hard to get accepted, but it's a great place to be if you do.\n",

Codeology is well known for their member buy-in, which is strong enough that for members in multiple tech clubs, nearly all of them choose Codeology as their favorite. They're not perfect, of course - no club is. Their interview process can be a bit frustrating. They have a ridiculous number of people on their officer board. But if you're looking for the tech club experience, and you get into Codeology (easier said than done), look no further than the avocado.\n",

These four departments drive forward BDAB's dual initiative of making data science accessible through educational and consulting services. Within the club are also the Internal and External committees, responsible for organizing BDAB's social and professional events. Our Bootcamp department offers a seven-week in-person data science course called Big Data Bootcamp for high school students at UC Berkeley twice a year, during the Fall and Spring semesters. To date, we have taught over a thousand students across the span of 12+ bootcamps. In Spring 2023, our Online Course department launched a free, self-paced data science online course called Data Science Demystified for high school students, making data science more accessible to everyone. The course features 120+ minutes of video tutorials, 12 lesson and assignment notebooks, and 8 modules. It covers an Introduction to Data Science, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Data Visualizations, the Data Science Life Cycle, an Introduction to Machine Learning, Statistics in Data Science, and SQL. Our course is accessible to all via our website at https://bd.berkeley.edu/online_course/intro/. Our Projects department provides data science consulting services to 3-4 paying clients each semester. To date, we have consulted for over 25 companies ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies across diverse industries. Our previous clients include American Eagle, Ulta Beauty, Tripadvisor, Intuitive Surgical, Applied Materials, Novo Nordisk, Annapurna Labs, Palo Alto Networks, and more! Of course, our educational and consulting data science services would not be truly accessible without our Marketing department. Through strategic advertising, social media, graphic design, and videography, they ensure that the public and our target clients are aware of all BDAB has to offer. In addition, they also host a professional photoshoot and design a variety of club merchandise every semester, exclusive to our members! Furthermore, our External committee provides exclusive professional development opportunities for all club members, from resume and interview workshops to large-scale events such as career fairs, Datathons, alumni career panels, and guest speaker panels directly from the data science industry. There are also many major data science events open to all members of the UC Berkeley community, such as Breaking into Data Science Research, where we invite professionals involved in cutting-edge data science research to talk about their work and offer advice to aspiring data practitioners. Lastly, BDAB is home to a vibrant and social community of members. This is made possible by our Internal committee that organizes fun social events exclusively for our members, such as a weekend retreat, an end-of-semester banquet, cross-club social mixers, and more!\n",

We are grounded in social justice. We understand that violence is rooted in oppression and that oppression is intersectional, so our approach must also be intersectional. We commit ourselves to expanding access, practicing inclusion, and undoing oppression wherever and whenever possible. We believe safety is a right. Every human in our community should receive respect for their bodily and emotional integrity and autonomy — always, in every situation. We practice self-care and kindness. Work grounded in these practices is more sustainable, effective, and transformative. We seek and value the wisdom of our community. We take a communal approach to our work, knowing that we are all learning from each other. We are optimistic and hopeful. We know that, as a community, we can eliminate violence and create the campus community we want. _______________________________________ Opened in 2014, the PATH to Care Center quickly became a cornerstone of support for UC Berkeley students, faculty, and staff. The Center’s first big milestone came when the Chancellor announced Berkeley would create a confidential advocate position, a crucial resource for survivors seeking services, as well as for those seeking to understand or pursue a university disciplinary process. Later in 2014, the first Bear Pact program launched, educating all incoming first-year and transfer undergraduate students about sexual violence prevention, with content designed and delivered by the University Health Services Health Promotion team. Following this, in the fall, the first advocate – who would go on to become the Center’s first director – was hired: Mari Knuth-Bouracee. The Center saw an immediate and overwhelming demand for services, which led to the ASUC and GA passing the Wellness Initiative Fee Referendum – a commitment of student fees funding several initiatives, including a new advocate position for the Center. This Referendum solidified the University’s commitment to expanding the Center’s resources for all who need them, and helped lead to rapid growth: two advocates were hired, sexual violence prevention education was included for the first time in graduate student education, and an Assistant Director for Prevention joined the Center’s team. With the rapid expansion and demand for services, the Center quickly grew out of its one-room office and into a new space that included two counseling rooms for client meetings, crucial for confidentiality, in early 2016. In mid-2016, the Center added an Assistant Director for Survivor Support, a Program Analyst, and two Prevention Program Managers. The need for the Center was clear – and in July, the US Office on Women’s Health awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department, to continue to expand this work. The Center then launched a peer education program, which began with the hiring of 11 peer educators, as well as a Care Line, the 24/7 crisis line for the University. Continuing its focus on graduate student sexual violence prevention, the Center hired its first Program Manager for Graduate Prevention. The Center also launched The Well, a Black healing space co-led by a Center advocate. Since its launch, the Center has continued to deepen its focus on both survivor support and prevention. By late 2017, videos created by the Center highlighting these practices had been shown to over 15,000 students, faculty and staff (and continue to be shown each year); the Center launched Yoga As Healing groups; and the Center received further recognition when the Office on Violence Against Women awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department. Another major milestone was successfully advocating for funding for a Prevention Manager for Staff and Faculty Programs; a role that was filled in 2018. Today, the Center continues to expand in both its staff capacity and in the services it provides, further solidifying its place as a key resource for the University.Contact us today for support!\n",

      "Error embedding: Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. was the first Latina Sorority on the West Coast and on the UC Berkeley Campus. Established in 1986, Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. continues to provide its members with a support system based on academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. The purpose of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. is to open the doors of opportunity to the Latinas of our community. Our primary focus is academic excellence and meeting the needs of Latina women in higher education. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. also promotes the advancement of Latinas through various campus activities and community services, and provides an environment for personal growth within a unit of sisterhood. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc.'s priorities, however, will be placed upon academic excellence and community service. Divine Delta Chapter | University of California, Berkeley | Est. April 6, 1991 In the Spring of 1991 three strong, brave, and intelligent Latina women, Jennifer Garcia, Maria Martinez, and Rosalinda Valdez felt the need to establish an organization that supplemented their needs as women in higher education at UC Berkeley. This need led to the formation of the Delta chapter of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc., and the establishment of the first Latina organization at UC Berkeley. Twenty-seven years later, the Delta chapter continues it's commitment to academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. Although we are a Latina-based sorority, we accept applicants regardless of race or color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or handicap. Pillars Academic Excellence, Community Service, Sisterhood Traditions Stepping: In 1987 the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. first introduced stepping to ladies of Lambda Theta Nu sorority Inc. by inviting them to step on stage in a unity step. Our sisters at California State University, Chico added the use of machetes as a symbol of strength, a symbol with direct cultural ties. Machetes: In 1989 Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. became the first sorority to incorporate the use of machetes in a stepping performance. The use of machetes has traditionally showcased the bravery of men. However, for Lambdas, breaking down this male-based tradition not only served as symbol of empowerment but also exemplified the determination of Latinas to integrate into every aspect of life that was not traditionally meant for Latinas. The incorporation of machetes in our performances personify our culture and our strength as women whose perseverance is multidimensional. Strolling: Strolling, also known as party walking, is a synchronized dance used to encourage commonalities among sisters and showcase our organization and/or to compete in shows. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc.

      "Error embedding: *New Callink Feature: Blue Heart Initiative 💙AboutJoining Student Organizations using the Blue Heart Initiative The Blue Heart Initiative is a feature on CalLink identifying registered student organizations that are classified as ‘open membership.’ These organizations may require a form to record demonstrated interest, but there is no formal application to be accepted into the organization. A blue heart [💙] placed next to the organization’s name on CalLink indicates they meet this requirement and opted-in to this feature. Look for this blue heart as you explore organizations to join. The Blue Heart Initiative is brought to you by the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) and Organization Advising and Student Involvement Services (OASIS). Frequently Asked Questions: 1) Is my RSO eligible to participate? Any Registered Student Organization (RSO) that indicates they 'accept all' interested members during the yearly registration process are eligible. These organizations may require a form to record demonstrated interest, but there should be no formal application to be accepted into the organization. 2) How can my Registered Student Organization (RSO) sign-up and get a blue heart added to our name? Eligible RSOs will have the opportunity to opt-in to this initiative during the yearly RSO registration process. 3) When will the Blue Heart be added to our RSO's Name on CalLink? Blue Hearts will be added to RSO's Names on CalLink on a rolling basis as registration forms are processed. 4) Does it matter if my RSO is a Graduate RSO? No, Graduate and Undergraduate RSOs are eligible to participate in this program. 5) Does my RSO have to participate in this initiative if we are eligible? No, you are not required to participate in this initiative. Your RSO must consent to participating via the registration process. 6) How does my RSO opt-out if we are no longer open membership? Please have an RSO representative (ideally the same person who opted into the BHI) complete the Blue Heart Initiative Opt-Out Form. 7) What's the difference between an 'Application' and an 'Interest Form'? An RSO may use an 'Interest Form' to record contact and other information for internal purposes, but they will not use this information to evaluate whether you can be a member of their RSO or not. An 'Application' is a tool used to screen potential members for interviews and, ultimately, membership.

      "Error embedding: Bay Area Scientists in Schools at Berkeley 💙AboutBay Area Scientists Inspiring Students (BASIS) volunteers foster scientific curiosity by connecting with kids and teachers through hands-on classroom experiences. BASIS is a science role model volunteer program that connects UC Berkeley graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and undergraduates with students in public elementary schools within the East Bay. There is a huge demand from teachers and students in our community to bring hands-on science and engineering lessons into the classroom! \"Tremendous! More, please!\" is the top comment from teachers who've had a BASIS visit. Program Goals The goals of BASIS are to (1) connect a diverse range of scientist volunteers to elementary school students and teachers, (2) inspire students with examples of real-world science careers and issues, (3) engage with students in hands-on, inquiry based learning experiences, and (4) create effective teaching links between scientists and public elementary schools in the East Bay. Program Mechanics UC Berkeley science and engineering students interested in becoming a BASIS volunteer must first sign up for a one-hour on-campus orientation (held on campus). Sign up for an orientation online (http://www.crscience.org/volunteers/signup). BASIS volunteers then form a teaching team (or join a pre-existing team) comprised of friends and colleagues in their field of study. Volunteers choose dates and times that they are available to visit classrooms and present a one-hour hands-on, inquiry-based lesson with their team. BASIS ensures that these lessons are age-appropriate and aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teams generally present in one classroom per month over the course of a school year (~10 lessons/year) though there is a high degree of flexibility to accommodate your schedule. BASIS teams begin by teaching one of the lessons from our database of kid-tested, teacher-approved lessons. Experienced volunteers may also take advantage of training opportunities to develop their own lesson.

      "Error embedding: Berkeley Bahai ClubAboutThe Berkeley Bahá’í Club is a student organisation devoted to the practical implementation of the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá’í Faith, on unity, justice, and selfless service. Bahá’ís believe social change starts with spirituality — individuals increasing their capacity for service and working for the betterment of neighborhoods and communities. In line with the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith, the Berkeley Bahá’í Club works to promote the essential oneness of humanity; to foster a spirit of fellowship and love among all peoples; to break down the racial, religious and other prejudices that are the greatest barriers to peace and unity in the world today; and to bring about the betterment of the world through good deeds and service. Since a necessary element in effecting such a change is the individual, the Bahá’í Club tries to nurture individual spiritual growth through the development of moral values, an upright character and increased capacity for service. To these ends, the Berkeley Bahá’í Club organises divers activities and events, including: ■ study circles for the systematic study of Bahá’í Writings and thoughtful discussion of spiritual, philosophical and sociological topics; ■ devotional gatherings for sharing prayers and inspirational readings from all religious traditions in a peaceful setting; ■ talks & lectures from guest speakers on relevant topics; ■ service projects as a venue for transforming words into action; ■ inter-faith collaborations to promote the basic unity of all religions; ■ social events aimed at creating fellowship. Membership is open to all. All who have an interest in the Bahá’í Faith's community building activities, irrespective of religious affiliation, are more than welcome to attend meetings and events. “And the honor and distinction of the individual consist in this, that he among all the world’s multitudes should become a source of social good. Is any larger bounty conceivable than this, that an individual, looking within himself, should find that by the confirming grace of God he has become the cause of peace and well-being, of happiness and advantage to his fellow men? No, by the one true God, there is no greater bliss, no more complete delight.” — ‘Abdu’l-Baha Contact Information Address United States Contact Email E: berkeleybahaiclub@gmail.com Additional Information INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO GET INVOLVED WITH THIS ORGANIZATION IS FOUND HERE Please check out our social media and website to see ways to get involved!Find information below about the OASIS Center organization category and who the administration contact is (see https://lead.berkeley.edu/meet-our-staff/):Callink DesignationOASIS Category: Spiritual RSOUndergraduate/Graduate Student CompositionMixed, with over 50% Undergraduate Students Primary Campus AdvisorLuly Sbeta at wsbeta@berkeley.eduAdditional Advisor, if applicable.

Indonesia is a rapidly developing country. It is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and is home to a multitude of great historical monuments and young intellectual minds. Through connecting students with keynote characters, alumni, and each other, BISA aims to be a platform of learning for its members where they can also inspire, and more importantly, be inspired.

      "Error embedding: Berkeley Political Review, TheAboutThe Berkeley Political Review was founded in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks by UC Berkeley students who wanted to offer a source of impartial analysis on the issues that most affect students and the world we live in. Since then, BPR has covered five presidential elections, the war in Iraq, the expansion and subsequent erosion of the European Union, immigration raids, drone strikes, the Great Recession, 20 years of Berkeley protest movements, the politics of ethanol, the approval of new medications, divestment from fossil fuels, the COVID-19 pandemic, and everything in between. We strive to provide cutting, original journalism on both the topics that dominate global headlines and those that slip beneath the radar of major press outlets. We have always been and remain entirely run by undergraduate students, from our newest staff writers to our most veteran editors and from our financial management to our coverage of Indian politics.

      "Error embedding: BridgeUSA at Berkeley 💙About The United States’ political climate needs drastic change. Politics has been rendered easy and dualistic, making blind-partisanship not only permissible, but the principal mode of political practice. It has become acceptable to immerse oneself in echo-chambers of like-mindedness, to label and blindly dismiss ideological opposites, and to violently rebuke instead of constructively disagreeing. There is no productive way forward so long as this persists. BridgeUSA wants to move the conversation forward, by allowing it to happen in the home of academic progress and innovation; the college campus. If we wish to create a better national sphere of politics, we need to start by creating better collegiate political spheres open to BridgeUSA’s guiding principles of responsible discourse, true diversity of ideas, and the creation of listening spaces. Our chapter will be at the forefront of this movement to fix national governance, by starting in the spaces where they learn, live, and grow into tomorrow’s leaders.

Cal Japan Club brings the Japanese student community together by providing networking, socializing, and career opportunities to Japanese, Japanese-American, and any other students involved with Japanese language or culture.

Open to anyone involved or interested in Japanese culture, we aim to create an inclusive space for the Japanese community and beyond, providing support through social and preprofessional career events. The official language of CJC is Japanese. However, as most of our social and career events provide English translations, we hope this will not deter any future members from joining our events!

      "Error embedding: Cal Rotaract 💙AboutCheck out our Website! calrotaract.org Check out our Instagram! instagram.com/calrotaract Stay up-to-date on Slack: Slack.2025 What is Cal Rotaract? Sponsored by international service organization, Rotary International, Cal Rotaract is a service club for individuals ages 18-30. Modeled after similar goals and standards to those of Rotary, Rotaract brings together college students and young business professionals for the purpose of humanitarian service, networking, building goodwill and promoting peace around the world. As one of the fastest-growing Rotary programs, Rotaract on the international scale includes more than 8,000 Rotaract clubs in some 155 countries. Each individual Rotaract club is sponsored by a local Rotary club, and is generally either university- or community-based. Each chapter has its own unique personality, sometimes with special emphases and focuses dependent upon the array of members and their particular interests. Like Rotary, Rotaract clubs meet on a regular basis, and are nonpolitical, nonreligious and open to anyone interested. Rotaractors address many of global and local issues pertinent to today’s society, developing projects that promote service, build friendship and provide a forum for cultural exchange. Why Join Rotaract? Service opportunities: The main focus of Rotaract is humanitarian service on all fronts–locally, nationally and internationally. UC Berkeley offers a variety of community service opportunities several times a month, many of which are local. Additionally, transportation is always arranged for members, so members can always get to events regardless of distance. Networking: Networking is key to any profession, so what better way to make connections than in a club that gives you direct access to Rotarians, all of whom are professionals at the top of their field, both undergraduate and graduate students in a variety of majors and fields of study, and young business professionals? Awards & Scholarships: Rotaract will give you the inside on Rotary-related scholarship opportunities as they come along, including those that have specific scholarships set aside for Rotaractors. These include the extremely prestigious Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship, The Scholar Ship and International RYLA (Rotary Youth Leadership Awards). International connections: One of the key benefits of Cal Rotaract is our affiliation with Rotary International, an influential community service organization that has clubs all over the world.

      "Error embedding: California Health Professional Student Alliance at BerkeleyAboutThe idea and first versions of CaHPSA, active under several different names, started around 2005 as a loose association of campus level leaders who had a passion for health reform and primarily organized around Lobby Day each year. Parker Duncan, the first Medical Student Fellow, was extremely involved in the development of the student leaders during these years. In 2009, involved campus student leaders, along with the statewide Lobby Day team, held their first student leadership meeting to brainstorm ways to structure the organization for the future. There was a general consensus that additional organization at the state level could be a useful tool for CaHPSA. The mission statement was developed from a rougher draft of the previous year. The core functions of the organization were agreed upon to be \"Educate – Advocate – Grow\" and statewide positions were developed from these core functions. CaHPSA at Berkeley too aligns with the belief \"health justice for all\" and endeavors to carrying the following goals: Support efforts to improve quality of and access to health care in California Provide opportunities for students to develop health advocacy and communication skills Educate and train future health and medical professionals to become effective health advocates Engender a sense of social responsibility among students Advocate for a single-payer health system We offer programs such as Project White Coat to certify students in helping more people enroll in health insurance and prepare for the annual Lobby Day which occurs in Sacramento.

      "Error embedding: Campus Dept | OASIS - Organization Advising & Student Involvement ServicesAboutThe OASIS Center helps you create your pathway to involvement in the UC Berkeley community. Want to establish a new student org, or re-register your existing student org? Want advising on efficient org management? We provide guidance to the resources that will help you succeed, from CalLink page management to funding, space reservation, and event planning tools. We're even here to help with effective promotion strategies for your org, and smooth transition tools for leadership changes. Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) at Berkeley provide a sense of community and belonging for our campus community. The Organization Advising & Student Involvement Services (OASIS) team is here to help student orgs achieve their organizational purpose while also ensuring a positive campus impact and healthy experience for members. University recognition as a Registered Student Organization (RSO), as defined in Berkeley Campus Regulations Implementing University Policies, gives your organization official recognition only while on campus. It also gives you the ability to access campus resources such as funding opportunities, event & facility access, and access to student organization event insurance. It is important to note that RSOs are separate entities from the University, and RSO programs, events, and activities do not represent UC Berkeley. Being a Registered Student Organization and RSO Signatory comes with many campus privileges and responsibilities. You will need 4 students who are willing to serve as the Signatories for your organization. The four of you will be responsible for upholding our university’s mission, values, and policies as they relate to the Student Organization experience. Visit the CalLink Organization Directory for a complete list of Student Organizations, and click here to meet the Student Org. Advisors. Questions? Contact a Student Org Advisor.

Concrete canoe competes annually in the ASCE-sponsored concrete canoe competition, where we are challenged to apply knowledge from our courses and experience from our team to a large-scale project. - The concrete canoe team is unique from other student organizations because we encompass many disciplines of engineering; participating in our team exposes students to disciplines like construction, materials science, structural analysis, and environmental engineering. In addition, as a competition team, we help individuals grow and build leadership and teamwork skills. Despite being a civil engineering competition team, we welcome students from all majors and backgrounds; this diversity helps bring new ideas and concepts towards our project and competition! - Our team is comprised of divisions, each specializing in a subject to allow for our team to function:• Construction• Materials Design• Hull Design and Structural Analysis• Graphics Design• Paddling - Our team holds a long history of success in our competition, and with our continuous alumni support, we enable students to call upon a large, knowledgeable alumni network.

The Daily Californian covers both the UC Berkeley campus and the city of Berkeley. The newspaper publishes every Thursday during the academic year and the summer. Established in 1871, The Daily Californian is one of the oldest newspapers on the West Coast and one of the oldest college newspapers in the country. The Daily Cal is run entirely by current or recently-graduated UC Berkeley students, and the majority of the business division of the newspaper is student-operated as well. One of the few campus newspapers in the country that is completely independent from the university it covers, the Daily Cal supports itself through advertising revenue and does receive funding from the INK Initiative, which requires all UC Berkeley students to pay $2.50 per semester. The Daily Cal earned its independence in 1971 and publishes with the name “The Daily Californian” pursuant to a licensing agreement with the UC Board of Regents. The move toward independence was initiated after the university administration attempted to fire three editors because of a controversial editorial regarding People’s Park, a university-owned lot in the Southside neighborhood of Berkeley that became an unplanned park for locals.

For over 30 years, we have been providing students with a creative outlet to choreograph, dance, and perform in a fun and supportive environment. Dancers are selected at the beginning of each semester and practice routines in various styles: Jazz/Contemporary, Open and Tap. Throughout the semester, we host social events such as movie nights, Mentorship Activities, workshops in a variety of styles and our End of the Semester Banquet so our dancers can get to know each other better. Each semester culminates in an evening showcase in Zellerbach Hall where dancers are able to show the pieces they have been working on throughout the semester. Our showcases attract over 500 attendees each semester and also feature guest performances from campus and local community groups to foster unity and promote diversity among UC Berkeley’s performing arts community. Danceworx also performs at campus and local events. If you would like Danceworx to perform at one of your events, please contact our Outreach Chair (dwxoutreach@gmail.com).

      "Error embedding: Federalist Society at Berkeley LawAboutLaw schools and the legal profession are currently strongly dominated by a form of orthodox liberal ideology, which advocates a centralized and uniform society. While some members of the academic community have dissented from these views, by and large they are taught simultaneously with (and indeed as if they were) the law. The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the legal order. It is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be. The society seeks both to promote an awareness of these principles and to further their application through its activities. The Berkeley Law chapter of the Federalist Society’s goals include: promoting thoughtful and challenging discussion of legal and public policy issues; academically and intellectually sponsoring conservative and libertarian law students; and ensuring that Berkeley Law students are thoughtfully exposed to conservative and libertarian perspectives and consider these perspectives in their analysis of legal issues. We put on a number of great events, which include bringing out leading judges, legal scholars, and practicing lawyers to address hot-button issues of importance to the Federalist Society. We are also a social club, with happy hours and some planned excursions in the mix. Membership is open to all students who are interested in thoughtful debate and the exchange of ideas, regardless of political ideology.

On campuses across the country, students run a successful social enterprise—a grilled cheese deli— to raise money and build public support for the end of extreme hunger and poverty. In the process students gain critical business, leadership and teamwork skills that serve them throughout their lives. Why grilled cheese? Artisan bread, gourmet cheeses, local produce and a panini press make for a mouth-watering comfort food that is sure to make you smile. The nostalgic simplicity of a grilled cheese is an irresistible invitation to everyone to make a systemic difference. By asking for a donation, we give everyone the space to manifest generosity by turning lunch into an opportunity to give back. People donate whatever makes them \"feel good,\" expressing their love for humanity and our earth with every penny. Every dollar students raise is invested in the Commitment 2030 Fund: A select group of organizations working to fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): a global initiative to eliminate extreme hunger and poverty by achieving an economically prosperous, socially inclusive, and environmentally sustainable human presence on the planet by 2030. www.feelgood.org Contact Information Address Berkeley, CA 94704 United States Contact Email E: feelgoodberk@gmail.com Additional Information INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO GET INVOLVED WITH THIS ORGANIZATION IS FOUND HERE Request membership through Callink, email feelgoodberk@gmail.com, or follow us on Instagram @feelgoodberk!

Then, in late fall, mentors will guide recruits through brainstorming sessions to help the recruits decide on a question they want to explore.

Additionally, workshops will be held to help students with career development, including applying to college. Students will also be encouraged to participate in local science fairs. At the end of the year, all FAST participants will present their work at a symposium where they will hear from professors, talk with college recruiters, earn student-nominated awards, and have the opportunity to win a scholarship.

      "Error embedding: Girls Into VC at BerkeleyAboutHistorically, venture capital is a male-dominated field, lacking diversity on the investment team. Women account for only 9% of venture capitalists, 8% of firm partners, and 7% of board seats. This not only negatively affects women interested in the field, but also companies and entrepreneurs. Many women are not taught about venture capital, think joining the field is an unattainable goal, and are discouraged from joining clubs or startups because of their gender. As a result, women are not being invested in because women are not making these decisions. Girls Into VC at Berkeley is dedicated to increasing the number of women in venture capital. The organization is many things – an advocacy organization, a professional development network, and a supportive community of friends. Through the organization, members will learn about the field, build practical knowledge, grow their network in the industry, and gain a supportive community of women interested in VC! There will be education about venture capital, speaker events, pitch competitions to encourage female entrepreneurs, partnerships with firms and incubators, and more! This club will be a chapter of the larger Girls Into VC organization. In just over a year, Girls Into VC has grown to 5K+ members and 100+ mentors in 60+ countries and 6 continents. We create weekly content, including podcasts highlighting prominent figures in VC, newsletters, blog posts, and more. We also have designed, launched, and manage multiple programs, including the Mentorship Program where applicants are paired with women in established funds, Externship Program where members work with startups on substantial 8-week projects, Scout Program where members meet with women-led startups and share their memos with our network VCs, and Fellowship Program where accepted students take part in a 10-week comprehensive introduction to VC. We also established the Girls Into VC Summit, bringing together 250 members for panels, workshops, and a pitch competition.

The Journal was imagined in 1980 and established in 1981 by Latine students and our allies at Berkeley Law at the University of California, Berkeley. The Journal is one of the few law reviews in the United States that center Latine conditions, communities, and identities. The Journal was established to provide a forum, which previously did not exist, to analyze legal issues affecting the Latine community. Previous issues have addressed bilingual education, affirmative action, immigration law, labor law and policy, voting rights, community empowerment, new models of organizing labor, rural communities, and Latine Critical Legal Theory. Each spring, we traditionally host a symposium to bring together law and other students, with professors, lawyers, activists and other community members to learn about and discuss current issues affecting the Latine community. Additionally, we irregularly hold colloquia and installments of our speaker series. These events and others are part of our evolving project to transform conventional legal education at Berkeley Law in order to help Latine law students and our allies become better advocates for social justice, self-determination, and liberation in the United States and abroad.

      "Error embedding: National Organization of Minority Architects StudentsAboutWhat is NOMAS? NOMA stands for the National Organization of Minority Architects, an organization dedicated to giving a platform for minority architects to advance their place in the architectural industry, fight social and environmental injustices (not necessarily limited to architecture), and bring unity to a diverse body through shared visions and goals. NOMAS is the NOMA representative for Student university chapters. Learn more about NOMA here: https://www.noma.net/about-noma/ and established NOMAS chapters here: https://www.noma.net/nomas-chapters/ Learn about SFNOMA here: http://www.sfnoma.net/ Why does Berkeley need NOMAS? And why now? Berkeley is famous for its student involvement with the social discourse and the individual unlearning processes of biases and stereotypes. However, the Architecture students of the CED represent a passionate, yet frustrated student body, regarding the diversity of architects studied, redundancy and hypocrisy in the curriculum, and the treatment of peers in the LGBTQ+ community. The CED has one of the most diverse architecture student bodies nationally; however, that statistic is not an excuse for an unsatisfactory student experience, academically and socially. Today, at the height of the BLM Movement, is a perfect opportunity for students and faculty to raise a NOMAS Chapter and foster productive dialogue for the benefit of the student experience.

      "Error embedding: Phi Alpha Delta Law Fraternity, International 💙AboutPhi Alpha Delta is UC Berkeley's oldest and largest pre-law fraternity, providing its membership with unrivaled leadership experience, tailored professional development, and access to an accomplished alumni network. Involvement in PAD is enriching, not only in terms of professionalism, but also in terms of personal development. As we explore the legal field and take important steps towards law school admission, we learn to work successfully alongside one another, developing broad interpersonal skills, tolerance, and mutual respect for our brothers and sisters. Cultivating Professionalism Our fraternity wants to do more than simply create a space where students interested in the law can come together. We want to provide our members with the skills and knowledge to go on to law school, careers in the legal field, and any other professional aspiration they may have. Through our Membership Development program, our professional events, and our many networking opportunities, members will find themselves graduating with a plethora of tools for their futures. Investing Service Law is not a field solely aimed at making money and gaining influence. Members of PAD find that we put just as much emphasis on the fairness and equity of law. To that end, our members take the skills they've acquired at Berkeley and in our fraternity to help the wider community and make a positive impact in the lives of others. Our Philanthropy committee makes it a point to provide accessible opportunities to reinvest time into making a difference. Promoting Fraternalism PAD may be a place to hone your skills for the future, but ask any member and they will say that one of the most important pieces of PAD for them is the community. By creating an environment where new and old members can get to know each other and form lasting friendships and meaningful connections, our fraternity ensures that, by joining, you become a part of the biggest family at Cal. Encouraging Leadership We take pride in giving members the tools they need to become leaders in the fraternity, on campus, and beyond. After the completion of Membership Development, new members have the opportunity to become more involved by applying to committee directorships. Others take the skills they've learned to become active in other organizations. We've had PAD members take leadership roles in the ASUC, Daily Californian, Undergraduate Political Science Association, Berkeley Project, and many many more.

We would love to learn from both western and eastern thought traditions, hoping it would inspire reflections on our past and future. “Philosophers have always been trying to interpret the world; the point, however, is to change it. ” We aim to open the door towards wisdom for young students, who are the future of the world. By pondering the constant meanings of those philosophical questions which have existed from the beginning of human civilization, it should be believed that the thoughts produced by the young minds have the power to lead the world forward. “Like bone cut, like horn polished; like jade carved, like stone ground. ” We aim to provide such a stable platform, not only for students to “cut and polish” themselves by questioning their ideas in deep reflections, but also for them to “carve and ground” themselves by proposing and engaging in genuine philosophical discussions. Discussions with other different minds is important because it would spark new thoughts as well as motivate us to think about the similarities behind all the differences. We hope that the Phil & Sophie’s Club will become the spiritual home of all those seeking wisdom, and together we will form meaningful bonds of thought, which will change the world.

In the past we have also achieved adjacent goals by partnering with corporate and academic sponsors who endorse the purchase of laboratory coats embroidered with the sponsors’ logos. We then distribute these coats to qualifying under-resourced schools, along with other materials intended to aid educators in taking on a hands-on approach to scientific instruction. Our motivation as a non-profit organization stems from our early exposure to science, which ultimately inspired us to pursue scientific educations and careers. Thus, our goal is to empower and inspire future generations of scientists by providing K–12 students the necessary tools to develop fundamental scientific reasoning, address societal problems, and move onto further scientific instruction.

      "Error embedding: REACH! Asian and Asian Diaspora Recruitment and Retention Center (formerly known as \"REACH! Asian Pacific American RRC\")AboutIn 1994, the Retention and Empowerment of Asian/Asian American Youths Considering Higher Education (REACH!) began with a handful of committed folks, as a program under the Asian Student Union (ASU) at UC Berkeley to target “Asian American*, high school students, especially those who are underrepresented, low-income, and non-college tracked”. Its goals were two-fold: 1) promoting higher education as an attainable goal and 2) empowering students through “building ethnic pride and programs that foster community activism and support APA* youth culture”. As REACH! grew organizationally, the vision and purpose of REACH! grew with it. While the mission remained, “the service and empowerment of recent immigrant and urban Asian Americans living in at-risk life situations,” we added on that “Our goal is to promote higher education as a means to empower ourselves and improve the economic and social conditions facing our communities.” We saw that REACH! had a unique role on campus and in the A/AA community at large, because REACH! was not just going to increase the numbers of underrepresented Asians at Berkeley but REACH! would be a training ground for future educators, activists, and leaders who would address society’s injustices through their life’s work. Thus, we created programs to raise political awareness, build coalitions, develop youth leaders, and build leadership in ourselves. Each year, programs have been refined and recreated by (insanely) dedicated and intelligent coordinators, who look for a better way to do things. However, our single most important legacy is the steady stream of community leaders we have and will produce. *As of May 1st, 2022, we have redirected our efforts from serving API communities to fully serve the Asian/Asian American communities.

I am interested in the intersection of business and technology and would like to know if there are any clubs that work on projects or with clients. Now I am looking for a club were I can learn a lot from and can apply the skills in the real world of tech. Maybe something along business and data science. Thank you!\n",
