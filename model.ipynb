      " - Hey guys! I am super excited to come to Berkeley in the fall and I heard that joining clubs is a great way to get involved. I applied here as Econ and I’m really curious about consulting clubs, but there are an overwhelming amount of options. The more I look at Reddit the more confused I get haha (why is it so deep??). I’ve seen some “ranking” posts that put some clubs over others, but I wanted some more information from current students about what these clubs actually are and how they are different. Any insights will be extremely helpful so I can get a sense of what I want to apply to, thank you!\n",
      " - Hi, I’m a freshman interested in applying to consulting clubs this semester. But…I’m a bit overwhelmed by the number of consulting clubs I’ve found just from searching the club list. Does anyone have any recommendations for which clubs are best? Or just some advice in general? I’ve also heard of some consulting clubs like Berkeley Consulting and Net Impact that are supposed to be pretty difficult to get into so Im a bit nervous about the process. Thank you in advance!\n",
      " - I feel you and I hate how hard it is to get into these clubs. You should come check out our new coding club called OpenSource that we're kickstarting this semester because of all these clubs being so \"exclusive\" on campus. We're trying to create an actual community on campus as an open and inclusive club. If you're trying to meet people and build connections, develop your programming skills with our project this semester, or prep for interviews, definitely check us out! We just want to make this school feel a little bit smaller. You can find us on fb or come to our info sessions on the 4th at 8pm at Barrows 20 or on the 6th at wheeler 204 @ 8pm. \n",
      " - i want to join a consulting club because i think it'll be helpful with my career and also for social life but i am not into drugs or hazing or anything too crazy. i've heard a lot of mixed comments about a lot of clubs on campus and wanted to know if anyone has any good advice on which clubs to avoid? or which clubs have a bad rep in general \n",

My major is molecular environmental biology (MEB) and I'm interested in going pre-med to become a dentist or a good paying job in my major.
