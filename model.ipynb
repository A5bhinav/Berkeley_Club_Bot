For all the incoming freshmen, this is THE ultimate guide based on funding, prestige, alumni network, and opportunities. Feel free to fight me in the comments on this.\n",

      " - I'm a freshman this year at Berkeley and was just wondering which consulting clubs are known to be the best ones bc there's way too many of them and I wanna figure out which infosessions to go to. Curious abt which clubs focus on what and which ones have good vibes and culture for making friends. Also advice for recruitment pls!! \n",
      " - Hey guys! I am super excited to come to Berkeley in the fall and I heard that joining clubs is a great way to get involved. I applied here as Econ and I’m really curious about consulting clubs, but there are an overwhelming amount of options. The more I look at Reddit the more confused I get haha (why is it so deep??). I’ve seen some “ranking” posts that put some clubs over others, but I wanted some more information from current students about what these clubs actually are and how they are different. Any insights will be extremely helpful so I can get a sense of what I want to apply to, thank you!\n",
      " - Hi, I’m a freshman interested in applying to consulting clubs this semester. But…I’m a bit overwhelmed by the number of consulting clubs I’ve found just from searching the club list. Does anyone have any recommendations for which clubs are best? Or just some advice in general? I’ve also heard of some consulting clubs like Berkeley Consulting and Net Impact that are supposed to be pretty difficult to get into so Im a bit nervous about the process. Thank you in advance!\n",
