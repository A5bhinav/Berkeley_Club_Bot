"Hello, 

I was wondering if anyone else would be interested in starting a troll club. We would probably meet up once a week for an hour under one of the different bridges on campus and do different troll things like collecting tolls, grunting, or just hanging out. I think the only requirement to join would be some kind of waterproof rubber boots. 

Edit: you could also go barefoot I think that would be more authentic.

edit 2: here is the discord link https://discord.gg/FmunCX2z",Don’t forget riddles
"I applied to 9 tech clubs (i’m an eecs major) and I got into the final round for 3 of them, all of which I would have loved to join. Just got my last rejection email yesterday, so I got rejected from 3/3 of my final rounds. It definitely sucks because of how CLOSE I got, and how these clubs definitely would’ve helped socially and academically, and now I do feel a little lost. 

Competitive clubs are definitely not the end-all be-all, and I’m trying to remind myself that.

Any recs for some ways to get my love for the game back? Any fun, uncompetitive clubs to join to just meet people?","if you’re deadass, i will absolutely join"
"[Berkeley club decisions today got me like:](https://preview.redd.it/6odsy1q00lnf1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae89bf76683631974bd18baaa90b7da8ae0b19a1)

how many rejections y’all at? I’m on 5 and counting ⬇️","I'm actually serious about starting it, if some people are interested I'll make a discord. I was thinking it looks pretty cool and temperate under the bridge at sather gate. I think it would be a nice place to hang out. "
Title. So exhausted of this kinda stuff. Heard some upperclassmen talking about nepotism and they told me it happens to literally every prestigious club every semester.,"definitely don’t go barefoot under a bridge, that’s asking for trouble"
"Over the past month on this subreddit there have been numerous posts about alienation from minority folk that I resonate with as one myself and I'd like to share my own experiences in regards to consulting club culture.

Why is there a legit vacuum of asian members in each of these 'exclusive' and 'prestigious' consulting clubs? Like seriously: look at the club photos on any of their site and it's very very monolithic. Take a look 3 club sites I thought of at the top of my head:

[https://www.voyagerconsulting.org/](https://www.voyagerconsulting.org/)

[https://dssberkeley.com/](https://dssberkeley.com/)

[https://pbl.berkeley.edu/leadership.html#executive](https://pbl.berkeley.edu/leadership.html#executive)

I think most people see through the bs of the image of meritocracy of the application process these clubs pretend to have. People know you're being judged by students who are 1-2 years older than you, and that 'vibes' are the main thing. The application process is akin to rushing a frat/sorority, but I'd like to wager within this realm of 'club vibes' is legit just discrimination based off color that even frats/sorority don't have. Look, I understand that a majority of rushees are white and thus it makes sense if greek life is majority white, but there still exists members of other races. Likewise, the majority of consulting club applicants are asian, but there's a very VERY noticable monolothic type of member that gets accepted.

I asked a couple of clubs during tabling about their DEI, and pointed out my observation of their inclusiveness. I've very literally been hit with: 'we see this as an issue' and 'it's because of inherit biases that people gravitate towards others who look like them'. Needless to say I felt estranged even after the info sessions where you have an opportunity to talk to the members. Out of the ten or so clubs I applied to I made it through two first rounds but didn't get accepted to any in the end.

Overall my takeaway is if you're a minority don't bother wasting your time and applying to these clubs.",Do we get to eat billy goats?
"I was kicked out of an ASUC-registered christian club for being queer affirming recently, and although they had no written requirement regarding it, they still decided that kicking me out was the best decision. In fact, the only requirement they had of me joining was that I was christian and shared the same core christian doctrines, so me being queer doesn't oppose that and there is very obviously discrimination against me.

When I mentioned this to a friend, she told me that this was a violation of a protected class and there had to be someone I could report this to.

I'm not too sure who I can reach out to, so any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: forgot to mention they receive funding from ASUC too lol",there are a lot of bridges that are cool to hang out under. Make sure to keep some variety
I am an incoming freshman at Haas next year and plan on joining a consulting club. I know a lot of these clubs have acceptance rates under 5% but what actually sets the 5% apart from the other 95%? Is it behavioral? Personality? Based on accomplishments? Grades even?,Lowkey down. I also know of a quest to be embarked around those areas.
Consulting clubs making us look bad smh,Was this ghost written by Charlie Kelly?
only way you'll be looked at,gonna plan the first troll club meetup soon! join the discord and come make friends
titles kinda self explanatory lol. didn’t even make it to the interview round despite having known half the board/directors for the year i was in it. need advice so this doesn’t feel so earth shattering and how to not take it personally lol. feeling at a loss also since this did give me hella opportunities that ill no longer have access to 🫠,![gif](giphy|98pZs1ZVaWb1C)
"Hi so I'm always the only friend who still plays roblox. Like I'm not horribly addicted but I still like to play sometimes, especially this new survival game with an evil deer. (Roblox, Minecraft, and Stardew Valley are my main rotation) I just started my 3rd year and I STILL haven't met anyone who likes to play. I know there's a gaming culture on campus but where??? Like every year during calawhatever in rsf I walk around the gaming side and it's just locked in guys playing intense shooting games but what about the rest of us?? Basically wanted to know if a chill video game club existed or just someone I can play roblox with. I can't tell if it's because I'm a girl not in stem that I still haven't found anyone but I wanted to ask here",I hope people will get your whimsy!
"Miss out on a consulting club this semester? I recently graduated from Cal and was a member of a consulting club, but a lot of my closest friends were in non-business orgs. Looking back, I realized they often had a much healthier balance: friendlier communities, lower time commitments, and (surprisingly often) solid career outcomes too. So I wanted to share some honest thoughts on those clubs from what I’ve heard — the ones that still have applications, but are much easier to join and a lot less intense than consulting or finance orgs. 

**Most importantly, most of the clubs in this list still have applications open as of today!**

# Engineering and STEM

**Space Exploration @ Berkeley (SEB)** – Members are insanely talented and dedicated. Every semester they design and launch liquid-fueled rockets in the desert, with the long-term goal of reaching the Kármán Line (the edge of space). Has a bunch of departments covering engineering and non-engineering work (sponsors, publicity, etc.). Almost all the upperclassmen have NASA, SpaceX, or defense contractor internships. Not the biggest party club, but everyone seems genuinely great.

**Formula Electric @ Berkeley** – Lower time commitment compared to SEB, with departments for building, racing, and marketing an electric-powered race car. Stronger party culture, fun members, and cool merch.

# Pre-Law

**The Berkeley Forum** – Student-run org that brings famous speakers to campus (Dylan O’Brien, Anthony Fauci, Jaylen Brown, Peter Thiel). Surprisingly strong placement across finance, law, and tech (they send a few people to Goldman, McKinsey, FAANG, JPM each year). Members are close, with different committees to apply to, a reasonable time commitment (4–6 hrs/week), and a strong social culture with retreats and plenty of socials. Straightforward application open to all majors and interests.

**ASUC Student Advocate's Office -** ASUC branch that helps students navigate financial aid, discrimination, academic dishonesty complaints, etc. All the members are very close, lots of club spirit, and friendly competition between committees makes for a fun experience. Anyone can apply for leadership, and the work feels genuinely impactful. Parties semi-frequently, usually pretty fire. App passed for this fall, but will recruit again in the Spring. \~7hrs/week time commitment, my friend in the club raves about it.

# Arts & Entertainment

**CALX** – Over 200 members run Berkeley’s radio station. Departments include special events, radio archives, music curation, publicity, and more. Less tight-knit because of the size, but they throw big parties and socials. No app required, just show up to intro meetings and put in a few hours a week.

**SUPERB** – The entertainment branch of ASUC. They host free concerts, movie screenings, game nights, and other events for all students. Don’t know anyone in it personally, but it looks like a blast for people into music, cinema, or arts.

**BAMPFA Student Committee** – Works with BAMPFA to get students involved with events like poster galleries, film exhibitions, opening nights, and art festivals. Full of art/film lovers. You can apply to different departments like marketing, film, or art curation.

# Volunteering

**Habitat for Humanity** – Huge club of volunteers. Not the most social unless you’re on exec, but they put effort into making meetings fun (skits, pranks, etc.). Leadership is solid and from all kinds of majors. Hard to track placements since most members join casually.

**Berkeley FeelGood Club** – Volunteers make grilled cheese sandwiches on Sproul, with proceeds going to Feeding America. Low commitment, fun vibe. Each semester, execs get an all-expenses-paid trip to Feeding America’s NYC conference. No application—just show up.

**BEAM** – STEM-heavy club where students teach local elementary and middle schoolers. Very wholesome, filled with kind and sharp people who genuinely care. Apps for this semester just closed (Sept 5), but they recruit every term.

# Other

**The Environmentalist Magazine** – For students interested in nature + journalism. Student-run magazine that produces 1-2 online issues per semester. Has different departments for art, photo, design, about 40 members total. Relatively new, but seems to have a good amount of socials like hiking trips, cookouts. Good exposure and practical reporting experience in a social group with low time commitment. 

**Caravan Magazine** – Travels each semester to a new city to document and write pieces for their magazine. Small and very competitive, but that makes the group extremely close.

**Berkeley Coffee Club** – Upperclassman-heavy club of coffee fanatics. They check out cafes weekly and sometimes host free tastings with their own brews. Low commitment, mostly just feels like a big group of friends.

**Poker @ Berkeley** – Hosts weekly poker nights with low-to-mid buy-ins and also runs the Poker decal. Chill way to meet new people, with a lot of overlap with business clubs and frats.

*Note that everything \^ is from asking around friends in clubs, so opinions may vary. If you have any questions or know anything about these clubs, feel free to add in the comments! :)*",can we sing songs like in the movies?
I'm currently trying to look for some clubs that don't require applications to be a part of. I like the feeling of being able to go freely to and from multiple places without the feeling of being locked into an organization or event. Does anyone know if there's a website that filters out clubs that don't need applications? I'm also looking for friends so if anyone else is like this as well I'm always down to go to cool events and explore new things. ,would it be a 10% acceptance rate like every other Berkeley club?
"My friend and I were enjoying dinner in the social lounge of my apartment(Standard) when this girl walked up to us and told us that there was going to be a meeting for UFA(Undergrad Finance Association) in the lounge. She told us that we might want to move to a quieter area since it might get loud, but we told her that we were okay with a bit of noise.  

Five minutes later this angry Asian guy walks over to us and starts pressing us, snarling at us telling us that we need to leave immediately, saying we’ve been told multiple times to leave. I tell the guy to stop being so rude and he starts growling about how he reserved the room, even though you can’t reserve that lounge at the Standard. After he started yelling and cursing at us to leave, I told him to calm down and said that we were almost done eating, and we would leave soon.  

My friend was obviously pissed since he actually pays rent here and who tf was that clown coming in here and yelling at us to leave. This is the first time I’ve encountered this kind of toxicity here at Berkeley. Are Haas students generally that obnoxious and entitled?",Would you also do a night crawlers club that coinsides with this one?
"Parked up in Telegraph-Channing garage and someone broke my window 🥲

I thought a parking garage would be safer than the street — I guess not.

Anyone know if there’s a camera or anything here? Strange thing is nothing is even missing from my car. Almost like someone broke it for shits and giggles; wtf.",I am so gonna be there I’m bringing beers who’s with me?
"Some Berkeley design club used Config tickets (worth $800/ticket) giveaway to bait students into a FAANG designathon, then several members kept all the sponsored tickets for themselves.

I am sick of the corruption and nepotism in these clubs, especially when our tuition is funding their existence and they’re gatekeeping opportunities from the rest of us.",I’m bringing beers!!!
"does berkeley not have like a running culture?? i’ve been trying to find some kind of run club or just like a group that goes on runs together + maybe chills after?? not just running running but like yk… socialising, coffee after, sometimes themed runs or even lil ravey post-run hangs lmao??

i’m from a place where run clubs are actually a big thing and i was hoping to join something similar at berkeley but i legit haven’t seen anything active so far?? if there are any pls drop them below i’d love to check them out

and if not… would anyone actually be down if i started one? like very casual beginner friendly vibes","the discord link says its invalid, did it get deleted?"
"My friends keep raving about how impossible it is to get into these consulting/prestigious clubs, even with their impressive resumes. I'm transferring in this spring and genuinely think I have a shot at it but I'm questioning if I'm in way over my head. As far as my experience goes, I have 5 months as a legal assistant at a Worker's comp law firm, a year working in Asset Protection (finance, estate planning, etc.), 2 years as a volunteer for big charity, and I was an English teacher in Lebanon over the summer. I basically have a strong background in law, finance, and NGO work.

I know career-wise I'm ahead of the average student, but I wonder if my experiences stack up well enough to be part of some ""Berkeley Elite"" clubs and organizations. I just don't know what to expect, and I wanna prep with these next 4 months the best I can.

Any advice?

Gah dayum y'all making this a genetics issue",Make friends with people in the clubs and try to get nepoed in next semester. Be subtle but it works
"Google [“snooroar”](https://www.google.com/search?q=snooroar+site:www.reddit.com) for more details. He creates these elaborate fake stories about how horrible his time at Cal was, how nobody would be his friend, how women humiliated him, clubs rejected him, and employers never hire him. He usually claims to be an EECS/CS major. These are all made-up lies. He never went to Cal at all. He posts similar stories on dozens of college subs, especially those with strong EECS/CS programs, as well as EE and CS professional subs. The posts are paragraphs long, and he often engages with the comments to bolster his story.

Other than the sob story template I outline above, you can also tell it’s him because his account is usually relatively recently created or only recently started posting. He only posts about his supposed woes, never about stuff a normal student here would discuss, or any Cal-specific knowledge. He also often has deleted posts in his history (usually the same exact tale of woe but in a different college sub, which he deletes before reposting it here), which you can see from the fact that his karma doesn’t add up to his visible posts, or from the fact he has comments in a deleted thread. At one point, he even had a whole sub dedicated to tracking his alts and trolling (r/snooroartracker), but it got banned.

Please report him if you see him. The mods are pretty good at taking down his posts, and the admins ban his alt accounts within a few days of him activating them.

Edit: got the former Snooroar tracking sub name wrong. Fixed it.",these will be the least important rejections during your time here.
"pretty much what the title says. i was  pretty overwhelmed at the start of the semester and didn’t put myself out there as much as i wish i had, and i was wondering if i could still join clubs. i’m not really looking for anything competitive rn, more like social clubs to make more friends. would it be weird to start showing up to meetings halfway through the semester?? ","Check out some of the no-application clubs! The vast majority of clubs that exist aren't all that competitive, people just don't glaze them 24/7..."
"I am an incoming female transfer student and I’m looking for club/group recommendations. I’m sort of interested in rushing a sorority, but I’m not a huge partier, so I’m not sure if that would be a good fit for me. My vibe is more crafting & baking than hiking & rock climbing. Are there any social clubs anyone can recommend? Rally Comm seems interesting, so if anyone has feedback on that, I’d appreciate it.",Can someone enlighten alumni on why people are getting rejected to clubs? Are these officer or other official positions you all are applying for? I graduated in 2013 and I recall being able to just join any club that interested me since they just always welcomed people
I’m looking for a native German speaker as a conversation partner for my middle school-aged son. Ideally I would love to identify a college student who wants to make a little money playing basketball or ping pong and chatting in German a couple of hours per week. Is there a German club at Berkeley where I could publicize this job? Any other ideas? ,I guarantee you many of the most successful devs didn’t bother with these. Remember that sheep move in herds. Work hard and you’ll be good
I'm tryna meet baddies.,"As an alumni who started a now 16 year old engineering club in Berkeley Engineering, seeing the club application discourse here is really gross.


What has happened to our 18-22 year old's during their childhood that made them think it's cool and normal to have a competitive application process for a college club?! When we recruited in college, attitude was the more the merrier. Why do people want to turn everything into gross frat/sorority exclusivity dynamic? Why repeat the trauma of college applications all over again on yourselves? Even for high-commitment clubs like ours (this was an engineering club where people spent 20-40 hours/week) the people who don't do anything wash out in like the first month anyway.


Kids these days, man.


/rant"
Lmk and I’ll rsvp maybe,"Don’t forget you can also create your own club! Great time since everyone who didn’t get in will be looking for a place to go. Best of all you can create the agenda, events, and content to be what you like!"
fuck consulting clubs all they do is jerk each other off all day and waste everyone’s time. ,No-application clubs are much more fun anyways!
"The worst part of getting rejected by so many clubs is the fact I wasted a week getting to know these people, wasted my weekend doing 2-3 rounds of interviews/club, and wasted my labor 3-day weekend. Shit just sucks. I don't know how to deal with it. yeah sure I'm not the brightest. I was able to make the 2nd/3rd round interviews for many of them. But the fact I can't even get into one just annoys me. Now I have to catch up in all my classes with no return on the invested time. It's just so awkward now because I see the same people who rejected me almost daily. 

incoherent rant over.",Pretty sure all the successful people I know either started their own or didn’t bother and focused on other things than a silly club that makes you do 100000 rounds of interviews when it’s all about connections anyway
"After speaking and going to many club events this past week I’ve come to the conclusion that you are all pretentious, clicky, and have no actual clue what you are talking about. First off I would like to preface my rant by disclosing that I am a highly successful entrepreneur and have made lots of money through business ventures and stock investments. After walking from table to table and listening to some of your club leaders I’ve come to the conclusion that none of you know what you are talking about. So for those of you feeling left out by these “elite” clubs, don’t worry, there is nothing that they can teach you that you can’t learn on your own or have access to. Everything these club leaders talk about is theory, none of them have actually ran businesses or made money. Some might have let’s say an “online” business right? Thats just code word for I resell shoes/vintage clothes, and when asked how much they make, they are quick to change the subject. 

Moreover, advice for these clubs. Don’t judge a book by its cover. I’ve attended many of your events and have met many of you. I often wear baggy clothes, shorts, and a hoodie. When I attempt to have a conversation with some of you, you are quick to end the conversation simply based on what you think I (or a person) is like based on our appearance. Little did you know that my intention of potentially meeting a club which was welcoming and inclusive was to donate and connect some of you to business opportunities. I wanted to connect a deserving club to my friends who run tech companies and private equity firms. But I found no such deserving club. 

I hope some of you read this and grow to have a more inclusive mindset. Nobody wants to hire a know it all. I’ve hired dozens of employees, and I would rather choose the humble person eager to learn, than the person who thinks they are hot shit. It’s easy to tell when people are genuine and authentic and when people are just playing out a role of who they think they should be. 

… maybe I’ll just start my own investment club and put up the capital to start a club portfolio. And use my contacts to help outcast get internships and job opportunities. See you all in class. Good luck. 😎","Ahh sorry to hear that 😭
Yeah in a sink or swim environment like Berkeley having clubs as a life raft is not only nice but at times necessary to have 

There are plenty of tech clubs that are open to everyone, such as the OCF, open project, or IEEE

Assuming you’re EECS or CS, keep your GPA up and try to get into honors societies like HKN, UPE, TBP, etc.

Keep your head up, Berkeley is a huge institution with amazing people everywhere"
First year freshman and I know my whole college career isn’t ruined and there are lots of opportunities to be explored. BUT i feel like I’ve put all my eggs into the consulting basket these past few weeks and it’s fallen through. I’ve missed a lot of other deadlines for clubs so what should I do next…..? Any advice? ,"A dumb question as a Cal parent.

Why are these clubs ""competitive""?  Isn't the right response ""Well we have only so much space in room X.  So we are forming a second (and third and forth) chapter.  Here is everyone's contact info and our officers will help you get started?

To me it feels like Gatekeeping for the ego affirming sake of gatekeeping."
"Chill both paths land at the same destination

  
Hate this all you want we're heading steady into a recession :) ",Why are these clubs competitive? This makes me tired.
"Club culture is really intense and scary, especially for new students entering such a big campus like Cal. Clubs, specifically those in finance and consulting, get a bad reputation for being so selective and elitist. Some for very good reasons, and some for no reason at all. After speaking with many friends who became involved with finance organizations, professional fraternities, and strategy consulting clubs, we realized how much they transformed our experiences and professional outcomes. Although that was our personal experience, we realized that some were hesitant given polarized opinions, which this guide aims to clear up.

On a more personal note, club recruiting is extremely mystified in my opinion at Cal. It's summed up by the quote ""Those who know don't speak. Those who speak don't know"". When students get bombarded at tabling with tens of hundreds of club sales pitches, it is hard to separate fact from fiction (especially when all that is publicized are such extreme takes). In my opinion, there are very few out there that are willing to have authenticity with transfers or freshmen especially who come to Cal wide eyed, so I wanted to share insights I've gathered in hopes of helping those students.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Disclaimers (please read):

1. As many people argue, you definitely **do not need to join a student organization** to have a great experience at Cal. Some choose to focus on classes and their GPA, pursue academic research, pursue professional roles directly, or a combination of all of them. It is evident that some students inflate business-oriented clubs to be a necessity, but my friends and I know so many others who are not in professional clubs that still have great experiences at Cal and reach their professional goals. Affinity groups, religious organizations, greek life, and other niche interest groups are a great way to meet great friends, have a great time in college, and reach your professional goals. *You can create your own path here. Everyone else's path doesn't have to mold you.*
2. However, saying that these organizations **WON'T** make it easier for you to reach certain professional business goals (mainly within high finance/consulting) **is most likely inaccurate**. Some alumni in these clubs go back 20 years and have pursued every career in finance, investing, entrepreneurship, consulting, etc. There undoubtedly is **a higher concentration** of alumni who have attained **professional success**, which naturally makes it easier for members to replicate. Things like mentorship, compiled resources, and the preferential treatment from alumni can help in essentially any role (apart from any post-graduate schooling). It may or may not be true that ""you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with"", but it's likely the case that the people you spend the most time with have the *highest probability of affecting you the most*.
3. This list mainly gives **opinions** on prestige and placements, but it also aims to show a laundry list of possible options that might make it easier to learn about these clubs rather than going down rows of tents each semester. Clubs at the top may be more ""successful"", but that *does not mean in any regard that you can't find success in any of the other clubs*. Conversely, it also means that clubs at the top do not guarantee any degree of higher success.
4. Other lists go into approximate acceptance rates, but these guesses are unfounded and hard to standardize. Most clubs take 10-12 kids a semester, with most around 6-10, *which already is less than 10%* if 100 people apply, which is almost certain given Berkeley's population. Taking devil's advocate, **it is important for clubs on campus to stay relatively small**, as that is exactly why they make the experiences of their members and why they are tight-knit. At the end of the day, just know you can find this experience in *so many clubs*, that even if acceptance rates are low, **any one club can equally be great for you**. Lower acceptance rates may mean more prestige, but that does not mean higher acceptance rate clubs can't help you reach success.
5. The issue of racial demographics within clubs listed **may be out of the control of the clubs**. A vast majority of these clubs tend to have CS, DS, EECS, Math, Econ, and Business majors, as those majors tend to be interested in the work these clubs do. Not only is Berkeley's population *disproportionately* Asian, but those Asians even more *disproportionately* make up the majors above. Applicants that tend to be interested in these clubs thus tend to be extremely *disproportionately* Asian. The issue is greater than just members trying to pick their own, with many **clubs largely trying to make as diverse classes** as possible, but failing given the amount of Asians that are interested and qualified. What is unfortunate and wrong is that **many clubs refuse to take juniors or older students** given that they want to ""invest"" in members that can ""contribute"" for as long as possible, which is genuinely terrible and discriminatory. However, some organizations are more welcoming and I will try to highlight those that are below.
6. Finally, I will **only be mentioning business organizations**. It's really hard to draw parallels between business and finance oriented clubs to tech clubs who have different objectives and target different students, so for the purpose of standardization, clubs mentioned will have at least some strategy consulting arm, professional/business help objective, or investing objective.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Strategy Consulting Clubs (24):

**- Clubs that reach out to companies to give recommendations/insights for real life situations they are facing in exchange for donations, which are basically payments for the work. For reference, technology consulting usually refers to building software in exchange for donations.**

*Tier 1A:*

**Berkeley Business Society (BBS)**

Strong placements across consulting and tech especially. Used to make new members sign a pledge to not join other clubs as many would use BBS to join business fraternities, but as of recently has been a very tight knit group of people who are super social. Have done national and international trips with consulting revenue, and have recently had a lot of Greek life ties with current members. Has a pretty big culture of getting members to buy into the club, which may lead to some self-obsession with the club but also leads to one of the tightest cultures. Used to be nicknamed ""Brown Boys Society"".

**Voyager Consulting**

Newest club in this tier (founded in 2012, spun out of BBS), but has an unmatched reputation given their super easy resume drop application that plummets their[ acceptance rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/opinion/rejection-college-youth.html). Take on Fortune 500 clients, and have lots in tech and tech clubs (ML@B members specifically), but have probably the best  placements in quant and finance, though results can vary. Culture varies vastly given many technical members, but has good retention due to making all members come to recruitment.

**Berkeley Consulting (BC)**

Their pitch is always that they are the oldest consulting club, which explains their strong MBB placements. They make their members work a lot, but are able to land huge projects charging the most money of any club due to their reputation. Culture has fallen off vastly compared to Voyager and BBS, with the club prioritizing for members with extremely impressive resumes rather than social fit, which explains why they have insane elitism and not as strong placements for this tier.

*Tier 1B:*

**Net Impact at Berkeley (NIB)**

Clubs with ""Berkeley"" in the name are usually well established given that administration banned the word for student clubs a while back, and this rings true for NIB. Mainly social impact consulting but they generate solid revenue with members mainly pursuing tech roles (software and product management usually). The culture is really friendly with nice people that are genuine friends, which is honestly great. Premier social impact organization, and known for taking older students.

**CMG Strategy Consulting; formerly Creative Marketing Group**

Formerly used to be a marketing based club (as the name suggests), but pivoted to make money as most clubs do. A lot of overlap with business frats (UBG and BAP specifically), but has really great diversity and has landed bigger projects with name brand clients. Members end up pursuing finance more so than other consulting clubs, but still have many opting for traditional PM or strategy roles.

**The Berkeley Group (TBG)**

Pro bono consulting (which means the club generates no revenue), but the culture is really great given that members aren't joining to sell out to free perks and join for community. People are genuinely nice, and the culture feels pretty tight. Members tend to recruit alright, especially in consulting and have good MBB pipelines. Mostly nonprofit projects, so if you don't care about F500 names then this is a fit.

*Tier 1C:*

**ABA Consulting; formerly Asian Business Association**

Another club that used to not do consulting, but pivoted to make money. The club is very east Asian, but they have extremely wholesome members who engage in a pretty vast variety of consulting projects with big clients. They also host a ""business"" talent show with the other business organizations that is lighthearted and gives organizations a chance to compete for fun.

**Valley Consulting Group (VCG)**

Strategy consulting for tech companies. People end up pursuing tech or consulting within tech consequentially. They value diversity a lot and being inclusive as of recently, but they haven't collaborated with top tech companies and received payment for the past few semesters and have had a reputation for being really cliquey. Known for taking transfers and inclusion initiatives.

**Venture Strategy Solutions (VSS)**

Strategy consulting that they claim is only for startups and small businesses, but in reality is for anyone who is willing to pay. Lots of big tech placements given they are startup-focused. They have drama sometimes but people generally enjoy their experience. Known to be more east asian than other consulting clubs, but is recently improving diversity wise.

*Tier 2A:*

**180 Degrees Consulting**

One of the few clubs here that is currently sponsored by Haas (has to use the Haas application). The members recruit so-so, with mentorship and good placements not being that abundant, and many members opting to join after already joining another organization on campus for shallow reasons (prestige, resume padding). Nevertheless, they engage in solid projects and generate revenue even though they are technically supposed to be doing non-profit work. A social bunch overall.

**Diversatech (DT)**

DT does some technology projects along with strategy projects, but overall as the name suggests is supposed to be about upholding diversity of demographics and interests. Members mainly do go into tech and PM roles, but they have not prioritized diversity as much as they tout as of recently.

**Upsync Consulting**

Like DT, they also engage in tech consulting and have recently been growing and generating a lot of revenue through big tech projects specifically. They are known for being extremely South and East Asian, but all the members seem to enjoy the club and are welcoming of other people. They also are able to afford international trips once in a while.

**Phoenix Consulting/Health Engine**

One of the two clubs listed that focuses on healthcare consulting, which attracts pre-meds or students interested in medicine/healthcare broadly (i.e. biotech, healthcare finance/consulting). Really good vibes given that they usually aren't selling out to big clients and value learning in healthcare. Also has a startup arm, Health Engine, that started a few years ago but has produced some pretty impressive funding for its portfolio companies.

**Healthcare Consulting Group (HCG)**

The other club that focuses on healthcare, which explains a lot of similarities (people who mainly are interested in healthcare). Again, good vibes given most members are there to pursue their passion for healthcare and not to make money, but the club has really good success getting paid projects anyways and hosting decent socials.

*Tier 2B:*

**Next Gen Consulting (NGC)**

Broad strategy consulting for F500 companies. Have been sourcing paid projects consistently and go international for trips. Culture is variant, as they are very South Asian and cliquey, but recently have had more diverse members, many with sorority and fraternity ties. Recently has been placing really well among consulting and business development roles broadly, but has some members not placing at all.

**Entrepreneurs at Berkeley (E@B)**

Initially started as an incubator for startups and entrepreneurs but has also pivoted to pursuing more traditional projects with companies recently getting a few pretty cool paid ones. Social culture is decent and friendly given recent success, but has no emphasis necessarily on member placement, only basically on ensuring their startup arm runs well.

**Nova Consulting**

Strategy consulting group that is one of the younger ones on this list (founded in 2023), that does a variety of strategy and some tech projects. Hosts solid socials, with members recruiting well above the standards of a club with its youth across tech and consulting. Members are extremely south and east asian and may be cliquey, but overall has a chill vibe with solid retention.

**Business Careers in Entertainment Club (BCEC)**

One of the biggest clubs at Cal with a focus on entertainment companies. Appeals to students with media, film, or sports passions naturally, but has mixed success being paid even when working with big name clients. Although the club is huge because anyone can be a general member while a lot less are on projects, the size overall leads many to use the club as a launchpad to join other organizations on campus. Members are laid back about projects overall given their passion inherently for the work.

*Tier 3A:*

**Global Research and Consulting (GRC)**

Another chain of clubs across the country, with some smaller non profit projects and some super small paid projects. Really good vibe as commitment is lower and members are really nice and chill about the work they do, but also has mixed outcomes in high finance or tech given many members opt to pursue different careers. Also known to take older students which is a plus.

**Phi Beta Lambda (PBL)**

Structured almost like a professional fraternity that devotes its time to professionally developing its members while also doing consulting to generate revenue, but doesn't have a fraternal vibe socially. Majority place at name brand firms, but may not be doing core business functions at those firms. The community is super inclusive with some cliqueyness, with exits really mixed across finance and tech.

**Consult Your Community (CYC)**

National chain of clubs that is supposed to focus on small businesses (that are in the community), but projects as of recently have had more of a mix of paid and in connection with big name clients. Has really great low commitment consulting but also has really mixed recruiting outcomes overall, with some not placing. The club structure makes most not that tight knit but everyone is cordial.

*Tier 3B:*

**Delta Consulting**

Consulting initially focused on EdTech, but has fully pivoted recently to any companies that would generate revenue. Members tend to be very nice and also very South Asian, but are known to not be cliquey with members being generally lighthearted about the consulting work they do. They place decently within software roles, but don't have any consistent recruiting success given its youth.

**Bay Area Environmentally Aware Consulting Network (BEACN)**

Environmentally-conscious consulting, usually with startups and other nonprofits. Vibes are really great given most are passionate about the work being done and decent mentorship all around, which is great for more laid back startup oriented work. Professional exits are weak and scattered across industries.

**SBC Strategy Consulting**

Originally focused on seed-stage startups, but has shifted to work for large Fortune 500 clients. The active members are close, but most projects are unpaid and sourcing is inefficient, leading to really bad retention and a vast majority becoming inactive. Still, they’re known for being inclusive—often admitting older students or those who don’t fit the traditional consulting profile. Weak exits.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Business and Professional Fraternities (5):

**- Organizations solely dedicated to social and professional development of their members, specifically through a pledge process. For reference: some of these fraternities generate revenue through consulting like the ones above, but most focus on establishing the strongest pipelines on campus and ensuring their members place well.**

**- Note: I will not be giving any type of tiering from now on given the insufficient number of organizations within these categories.**

**Undergraduate Business Group (UBG); formerly Delta Sigma Pi (DSP) and Rho Consulting**

The most scrutinized club on this list by a mile, and for good reason. They undoubtedly have the most intense pledge process of probably any organization on campus, but they also have the best pipelines as well. The pledge process is the most grueling out of all of the business frats, with a lot of wet hazing and late nights (which explains why they got kicked off campus twice hence two name changes). Every single member basically opts to do investment banking (even if they don't like it which causes some to regret their decision later), but they are extremely good at placing well. They have direct pipelines to Goldman Sachs' TMT office in SF and an alumni network that is practically unparalleled. Their pledge process definitely leaves members traumatized and causes social culture to be extremely toxic, but also results in the members that choose to be involved, really active, and form their only social circles within the club. The club also scrutinizes members who choose to join other organizations on campus, which proves more toxicity and the inward social circles.

**Collegiate Business Association (CBA); formerly Alpha Kappa Psi (AKPsi)**

Similarly to UBG, CBA had a name change and is known for wet hazing their pledges extensively. However, although their placements are not as good as UBG's, they still are extremely elite with many going to top banks and firms across the country. Given that their process is not as grueling as UBG, many say the social culture is far better but still toxic given the members aren't as resentful to older members who used to haze them. Many members utilize help from older members to join other clubs like BIG, UFA, and BFC to get more learning and connections as well.

**Beta Alpha Psi (BAP)**

Almost entirely East Asian business fraternity, but recently have made the fraternity slightly more diverse. Similar to CBA, all their placements are extremely elite within finance across the country with the process not being as grueling as UBG's but still including a significant amount of physical and wet hazing like CBA. Also like CBA, specifically known to send members to other clubs like BIG, UFA, BFC, and CMG. Has a common toxic culture given resentment to older members for hazing.

**Pi Sigma Epsilon (PSE)**

Originally a marketing fraternity, they have since shifted into a more multi-disciplinary professional fraternity of sorts, sending members all over to strategy, consulting, finance, and PM roles. Their pledge process is not on any level near the big 3 business fraternities listed above (i.e. wet or with extreme tasks), but still is effort. Generates solid revenue from their consulting arm, ZC Consulting, allowing them to go on international trips every so often. Culture is definitely less toxic than the others, and is known to take juniors and junior transfers as well which is a good sign of inclusion.

**Alpha Epsilon Zeta (AEZ)**

All male professional fraternity like PSE with mostly south asians. Although the only fraternity on this list that only takes guys and isn't nationally based like the others listed, they do have a decent alumni network across a lot of disciplines at top banks and tech companies, with the same focus on placing well like other business fraternities and a process comparable to PSE's. Notably does consulting on the side like PSE and runs a really big startup event with venture capitalists in the area, but are a more mix of a social fraternity given ties to other south asian organizations and also given social parties and events that they host as well. Also takes juniors and transfers.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Investing and Finance Organizations (5):

**- Organizations that are the closest to affinity groups on this list, with the main goal of the clubs to teach its members about finance or investing.**

**Berkeley Investment Group (BIG)**

Probably the oldest non rebranded club on this list, founded in 1997. Student-run hedge fund that creates investment pitches in public equities with over $140k in assets (provided through alumni donations). Has a rigorous and extensive education process for first semester new members with return offers given depending on the quality of work, which results in members that are really knowledgeable but more socially absent. Has relationships with Point72 and Citadel and consistently sends members there along with other extremely prestigious banks and hedge funds mainly. Many members as of recently come from professional fraternities, but the interview process is still extremely meritocratic however given that the initial application is a fully anonymous stock pitch.

**Capital Investments at Berkeley (CIB)**

Student-run hedge fund founded more recently in 2013. Notably invests their over $100k through other strategies and not necessarily just pure public equities unlike BIG. Has a rigorous education process as well with return offers on the line for entrance into the club, and elite placements in finance across the board given the rigor of that education and similar relationships with Point72 and Citadel. More socially tight knit compared to BIG with their interview process prioritizing for fit and willingness to learn rather than pure investing ability, and has more internal and cross club social events. Notably has a Quant division with members educated in the technical side of investing that has a track record of producing many quant developers and software engineers.

**Undergraduate Finance Association | Undergraduate Management Consulting Group (UFA|UMCG)**

Connects members with club alumni to ensure placements, with those members becoming alumni and naturally giving back to the club that helped them. It has the largest laundry list of elite placements for a club across banks, hedge funds, private equity firms, and consulting firms (maybe tied with UBG). The engagement among members is limited given the focus on connecting with alumni, and the interview process (especially for older students) is extremely grueling as they want to test whether you will pass actual job interviews. Known to not take juniors and rarely ever take sophomores.

**Undergraduate Finance Club; formerly Berkeley Finance Club (BFC)**

Fraternal values in the sense of a pledge-esque process and emphasis on members recruiting well, but they are successful at that goal, with members helping each other during intense interview processes for finance roles and most members placing at great investment banks usually. The culture is more fraternal, but that also means that members are really tight knit and care to give back to younger members when they recruit for internships.

**Blackskies Investments**

Super new club; international founders gave $1.3 million to make it the highest AUM (assets under management) investment club at Cal. Initially made to invest in a lot of asset classes, they recently shifted to VC only and focusing on the founder and startup ecosystem. Given its youth, the club is really decentralized and does not have a record of having a robust education system that teaches its members or placing anywhere although some place at some mid-tier banks or venture capital firms.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Other Related Clubs (25):

\- There are so many other clubs that would take a whole dissertation to finish discussing, so I will give brief descriptions instead. These clubs may not have consulting, investing, or professional help objectives, but are generally finance, business, or startup oriented.

\- **AI Entrepreneurs at Berkeley (AIEB)**: Accelerator and incubator for AI startups with some of the most impressive fundraising numbers from Berkeley.

\- **Blockchain at Berkeley (B@B)**: Cryptocurrency consulting and education. Richest club at Berkeley given extremely early cryptocurrency investments, which allows for tons of international travel.

\- **Undergraduate Real Estate Club (UREC)**: Real estate focused education and community. Really solid placements in real estate and finance. Welcoming vibe with many members in other clubs.

\- **Free Ventures (FreeV)**: Startup incubator and accelerator with a fellowship program, but has not had as much startup production as AIEB as of recently. Good VC connections.

\- **Berkeley Venture Capital (BVC)**: Club dedicated to teaching VC, running occasional pitch competitions and involving themselves in the Berkeley startup ecosystem.

\- **Women on Wall Street**: Haas sponsored organization dedicated to helping women place in high finance roles across the board. Super inclusive given its focus.

\- **Chinese Finance Club (CFC)**: Similar to BFC or UFA, in the sense that it is a network targeted to Chinese students to leverage to reach their professional finance goals in terms of placements.

\- **Ascend Berkeley**: Pan‑Asian focused professional student organization empowering Berkeley students with professional help across industries, with extremely variant exits. Haas sponsored.

\- **Scholars of Finance (SOF)**: National chain of clubs that aims to educate its members about finance. Does mainly research and education work on a super small scale, but no really good placements.

\- **Microfinance at Berkeley**: Consulting for small businesses pro-bono across the Bay. Wholesome community given the true pro-bono premise of the org.

\- **Haas Business Student Association (HBSA)**: Acting student government over Haas initiatives including maintaining corporate relations with sponsors, keeping social media up to date, and helping students at large. The application process is very inclusive, with many joining as general members.

\- **Berkeley International Consulting (BIC), Core Consulting Group, Optimir Consulting, Paragon Consulting, Undergraduate Economics Association (UEA), Azure, Business Review at Berkeley (BRB), Berkeley Economic Review (BER), TAMID Group, Healthcare Business Association At Berkeley (HBAB), Haas Undergraduate Black Business Association (HUBBA), Latinx Business School Association (LBSA), Berkeley Women in Business (BWIB), Piedmont Consulting Group** are all various consulting clubs with presences as well.

# Final Thoughts

If you have read through all 54 of these clubs, you probably can tell that these clubs **don't have that many differences at all** which is why there is no point for a lot of people to stress about them unless you desire something that only a specific club has (e.g. industry focus, alumni network, placements at certain firms, type of work). There is no better way to truly learn about your fit other than talking to the members and asking them questions directly. *Only you will know what you truly like!*

I hope this was helpful to anyone reading, and feel free to list any thoughts you have on clubs at Berkeley specifically below. ***Negative or positive thoughts are welcome.*** All discussions are important for people to gauge whether or not clubs are right for them! And as always, Go Bears!","Don't worry if you got rejected the first time, you can apply again in future semesters and hopefully you get in considering you were really close."
"Recently I just applied for a club that was ASUC covered and I got rejected by them after the interview as a first semester transfer student. I don’t know what went wrong? They liked my application however I did mentioned that I was a first semester transfer student who commutes during the interview (they only do one interview). Did I just dig myself my own grave? 

I srsly need advice cause all my other transfer friends are also getting rejected by clubs and internships. :( ",happened to me too lol
"Hey everyone!

Was trying to look for bookish events/clubs in Berkeley and there didn’t seem to be many so was thinking of starting something 

Silent book clubs were introduced to me recently and I think it would work well at Berkeley. 

Unlike a traditional book club that reads a pre-selected book each month, everyone brings their own book and we read silently in a group. I call it “adult silent reading time” lol

Would anyone be interested in something like this? I was thinking we’d read in a cafe, park, or somewhere on campus maybe every other week

if you think this is a cool idea, dm me your insta and maybe we can start a group chat
","I'm biased towards my own club ([Pioneers in Engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1neidvw/looking_for_an_open_techengineeringstem_outreach/)), but there's also CSUA, OCF. There's also Open Project, which accepts everyone but only if you attend their welcome events (so too late for this semester, but you could join beginning of next semester). Also, many physical engineering (e.g. not CS-focused) clubs ([most on this list](https://esc.studentorg.berkeley.edu/clubs.html)) are open and not application-based because they are required to be for Engineering Student Council Blue & Gold certification.

For groups that aren't technical in any way, cultural and sports clubs and are great for meeting new people."
"I saw a post last semester that mentioned a potluck club on campus. I love cooking so it seemed perfect but I haven’t seen any posts on their insta from this semester, so have been wondering if it’s still meeting.

I have been making all this food but I can only share so much with the homies!

Hope everyone is holding up through midterm szn",This seems so bizarre to me. I feel like time would better be spent applying to internships since at lest you will be getting paid for your work
the meta is evolving ,"honestly many people still apply to clubs every semester even as juniors! if u really want to join, don’t give up and u will eventually get in. most importantly network with the people in the clubs and be friends with them"
"I'm from the berkeley emerging technology association, a relatively new group on campus. So recently, we somehow got a large sponsor for a hackathon allowing us to run an event in San Francisco with 50k+ in cash and credit prizes. However, we need more participants to secure the support of the sponsor. So, please consider joining:

"I am a freshman at Berkeley studying Economics and hopefully Data Science. I know people say not to worry about consulting clubs on campus because they're so competitive, but I really want to try my hand at it at least once. My only issue is that all of the infosessions for every single club seem to overlap next week. I initially wanted to go to the ""top"" clubs like Berkeley Consulting and Berkeley Business Society, but some of my upperclassman friends have been saying that they fell off and that clubs like Voyager Consulting are now more respected than them? I don't get it what is the lore? And I know there are other clubs like Net Impact Berkeley, Venture Strategy Solutions, etc., but which ones would actually be worth my time applying to and attending infosessions for?","Clubs don't matter that much tbh. So much inner politics between students. It's good to get involved with something on your own like a side project, or internship/research."
"hi! i love reading and talking about comic books but i can’t find many other people at berkeley who also do! i’ve looked on the club websites and there isn’t anything, but do any of you folks know about any comic book clubs on campus? and if they don’t exist, would anyone be interested in joining one that i would create?",sophomore here and i still havent gotten into an application based club its rough out here
"HELLO BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE!! We're trying to start a Ninja Warrior Club where we use nearby Ninja Warrior training facilities (it's in Richmond). We already got INSANE discounts ($10 per person) for 4 ½ hours of using their actual equipment with coaches to give us pointers by request with any obstacle & creating courses for us with better discounts to *likely* come (as well as basically private lessons for anyone interested). Even if you don't know if you'll ever come, shoot me a message if you're interested! I don't want to post the group chat link here for safety reasons, but I'll send you all the link if you shoot me a message :) Actual Ninja Warriors go to this facility to train, and the coaches are extremely experienced! (I can send you some video proof via reddit messages if you're interested in seeing their work in action) We also do not have officers set in stone yet, so anyone wanting to be an officer has a chance to! Shoot me a message or leave a comment and I'll answer any questions that you have :) Go Bears!",Look into URAP! Another great way to get involved
I have enough experiences that I do not need to join clubs to get experiences. My main reason for joining clubs will just be social and making connections. And I would like to explore 3 or 4 clubs instead of just being in one. Can I just attend the meeting or events instead of applying for officer positions?,"Sorry to hear that  
  
Though I feel like clubs are overrated

Start your own side projects or small startups

Collab with your dormmates, classmates, study buddies, friends to solve problems and learn new frameworks, tech, programming languages, and software all the while

Post about your progress on TikTok or YouTube or LinkedIn (and make friends with the people that give you feedback)

Constantly update your portfolio"

"Hey folks, I'm currently an undergrad set to graduate from UIUC this December and I'm going to be heading back home to the Bay after.

I kinda don't want to be stuck in the suburbs after graduation and still want to be a part of the student social scene since I'm still just 21. I especially enjoy school clubs that are focused on deep conversations about philosophy, books, movies, et cetera.

Are your RSOs/school clubs cool with non-students joining in as well by any chance? If so, where do you typically find all clubs?

I could also become a non-degree student I guess... but I'm not particularly interested in pursuing any further studies at the moment and it would end up being JUST for the Cal ID to register with clubs (if that's a requirement) lol. I could also become an official volunteer I guess but yeah not sure.

Important information:

\- There are courses and training opportunities for ALL skill levels and levels of commitment. Interested in competing? We got you. Just want to goof off with some friends in a more exciting playground? We're there. Want to humble some egos, maybe even your own? Go for it! Need to get some zoomies out in a new, extremely discounted, and awesome environment? Sign up!

\- The gym gets updated pretty frequently which different courses/obstacles being altered or replaced in some way, so it will probably be a little different every time that you come :) You can also make your own course that staff can time you in (to compete with friends or just to see how fast you are), or the staff can make one for you!

\- We do NOT have a schedule set up yet, and are making it based on YOUR schedule, so please use the link in the general-info channel to let us know when you are available!

\- Officers have not been chosen yet, so if you are even a little interested, let us know! 

\- We \*WILL\* be getting epic discounts on the gym, less than $15 but actual numbers are still up in the air.

\- If you really like the gym, you can get more private lessons! While they are not advertised as one-on-one, they are extremely intimate because this gym is not super popular, so you might get a one-on-one class

\- Because this gym is not extremely popular (it's just a pretty niche thing, there is nothing wrong with the gym at ALL. A handful of clubs at Cal went to check it out last Friday and it was INCREDIBLE), it is usually pretty empty too!

\- The gym is in Richmond, so there is a commute necessary, but it is not very long. Here is the gym if you want to check it out: [Home | Traverse Fitness](https://www.traversefit.com/)

","Students should be more mad about this. When a student gets an elite job outcome (bulge bracket investment banking, MBB consulting, big tech product management, quant trader at a hedge fund, or AI researcher) 9 times out of 10 they were part of one of these elite clubs. The entire trajectory of your career (and life) can change based on you impressing a group of 19 year olds from the same Bay Area or SoCal high schools whether you’re cool enough to hang out with them or not. 

These guys gate keep access to the alumni networks and referrals so that only their kind gets the leg up on recruiting. They also are the only ones getting career ready through structured case competitions, client experiences, and resume/career workshops. If the school really does tout DEI, it should first and foremost remove these barriers because everyone pays the same tuition, but clearly only some get the full Berkeley experience.

"Pioneers in Engineering builds and runs a robotics competition for local high schools at a low cost to the 15-20 schools that participate annually. Our competition gives high school students regardless of socioeconomic background an opportunity to explore engineering, while being introduced to the UC Berkeley campus, students, and professors.

To keep the competition up and running, we have a combination of software, hardware, and outreach teams that are looking for new members👀👀

Here are our software teams:

* Dawn: builds the code editor the HS students use to program their robots
* Runtime: writes programs pertaining to the network of student computers, motors, servos, & competition code
* Shepherd: creates field control software - automates part of the competition. (e.g. last year, when the high schooler's robots were able to press a combination of buttons in a row, their scoreboard automatically updated. The buttons lit up in the order they were supposed to be pressed, and if the high schooler pressed the wrong button/took too long to complete the task, the game would disable itself for a period of time.)

And here is our electrical team⚡:

* Electrical: builds power distribution boards (PDB's), printed circuit boards (PCB's), & solders other components. Many on our electrical team who put the fact that they designed & created a PDB on their resume find companies interested in this project of theirs.

As mentioned above, we also have teams for *game design*, *data analytics/business operations*, *school outreach*, and for *mechanical engineering*.

**If ANY of this interests you, you're highly encouraged to join! ALL majors and and backgrounds welcome - even if you haven't worked with robotics before, we'll teach you what you need to know.**

I have not experienced racism in the club I am a member of yet, but I can see how it would be difficult for students from historically underserved backgrounds to gain access. Instead, I would argue these clubs are more classist than racist. Most of the students in these clubs come from privileged backgrounds. They work very hard for a lot of the accomplishments under their belt, but a lot have had access to tremendous resources.

Regardless, classism is the cousin of racism, and the way these clubs recruit produce discriminatory outcomes.  I mean, some of these clubs don't even have a lot of white students. Some of the white org's are more diverse.

Seems like a harsh conclusion to take without any numbers. Again the top one looks reasonably diverse."
"The Cal Sailing Club apparently has used six slots for its small sailboats at the Berkeley Marina for about 50 years. The Berkeley City Manager has now proposed evicting them so those spaces can be rented to larger private boats for more profit for the City.

I should say that I'm *not* a part of the Cal Sailing Club and not familiar with the details of this particular controversy, but the organization has a good reputation and focuses on providing low cost or free opportunities for sailing on the Bay and teaching people to sail. And they make a compelling case in their petition (see links below). They say they provide 2,500+ people with free rides / sails on the Bay a year, and have 1,100 ""active annual memberships"". They need their specific current location so their small sailboats can *""maneuver in and out of the marina under sail.""*

I should also add that I'm not surprised to see the City wants more money here. This is part of a long term pattern. Key people on the City staff, IMHO, are focused primarily on ""generating revenue"", often undermining or killing popular community activities as a side effect. The popular Berkeley Kite Festival which thousands of people attended every July, and was held adjacent to the Marina in Chavez Park was done away with in this same sort of way, with the City suddenly demanding vastly increased fees for hosting the festival.

","sorry to say this but asians on average are just more accomplished on any objective merit-based scale. This is evident in literally everything aside from sports. You can say its due to socioeconomic background or whatever. But it's a fact that on paper, Asians are better. Any educated person would agree to this, including minorities and whites. Let me be clear, I'm not making any inherent attachments to race and the merit of an application. I'm just saying that statistically there are more Asians with better GPA, Resumes, test scores, internships etc. There's no point ignoring that.

The real world isn't your college apps. Yes, social connections matter but so does the resume screen as well as how you literally perform during the interviews. You can't expect a Holistic assessment of a club recruitment process buddy.

Another reality check for you, everyone in STEM is fucking asian in this school. I'm an international and I've been in the US for 3 years now. To this fucking day, I still cannot come to terms with the fact that I came to America and see more 100x East/South Asian people than I do white/hispanic/black people. You can walk into any STEM class and WHITE people are the minority and most of the time there isn't even >1 black person... Asian people dominate this school - SHOCKER! The people who get recruited for these clubs are mostly STEM & Business majors who are mostly, you guessed it ... ASIAN.

These consulting clubs have < 5% acceptance rate. I've never once seen a black person during any of my club interviews. I'm sure they're out there and there are black/white/Hispanic people who do apply but the number of people applying who are asian is so much higher so it's no surprise that the people that get in are mostly Asian. A lot of these clubs also literally ask applicants to remove their name and identifying information from their resumes too.

Like no shit everyone's Asian. I'm not saying nepotism doesn't exist. It absolutely does and is really bad. But tying Race to this type of nepotism is the most amount of copium anyone can take. From any objective viewpoint, there is no statistical necessity for the number of non-Asians to be anywhere equal to the number of Asians in these clubs. Unless you're asking these clubs to employ some sort of diversity hire / affirmative action policies which is honestly just more insulting to minorities at this school.

Like I said, nepotism definitely exists here. But I highly doubt that anyone is actively trying to recruit their friends only of a specific race. There is neither a subconscious nor conscious desire to make an asian monolithic culture in these clubs. Its just a fact that there's an undoubtedly high statistical likelihood that these clubs will get dominated by Asians.

It's just pure copium to say its because of race. You applied to 10 clubs and only made the interviews for 2 and didn't get past the first round for either. Now go and take a look at the number of asians who applied and did the same if not worse than you. I know several asians who applied to 10+ clubs and didn't make the first round for any. I also know many who applied to 10+ clubs and didn't even get into one at the end. It just so happens that competitive processes tend to be competitive ..."
"I applied to a very large number of data science and tech clubs this semester and eventually got rejected from all of them. I’m kind of sad about it especially as I had made it to the final round of my favorite club but fumbled the behavioral interview due to nerves, but I’m also trying to be proactive and see if I can make the semester even better than if I had joined the club. 

What I really wanted out of the club was the social / community aspect of it and the technical skills development portion of it, and I don’t really need to be in a mega-competitive club to fulfill these things. The second one I can definitely achieve on my own this semester as I have some personal projects I’d love to work on and I can totally self-learn a lot of things, so I’m mostly looking for fun clubs with a lot of social opportunities and no or minimal application.

And I’m just kinda laying low right now because I gave it a lot of thought, and I don’t really think that outing myself or leaving would be the best thing to do at the moment.

Hello everyone! I am an incoming sophomore majoring in Data Science. Last semester I applied to the DS clubs and even went to their info sessions & events but got rejected. I am interested in the intersection of business and technology and would like to know if there are any clubs that work on projects or with clients. Now I am looking for a club were I can learn a lot from and can apply the skills in the real world of tech. Maybe something along business and data science. Thank you!,they can probably get shut down for this...

"I’m interested in joining an organization/student club at Berkeley that helps others with things related to mental health, bullying, finding resources, not feeling alone, etc. 

I’ve come face to face with a lot of bullying and bad people in my life and I don’t want others to feel how I do. 
","u/OppositeShore1878 already gave good advice, I hope you’ve read through their links. 

I just wanted to say though, I am **SO SORRY** to hear about how you got kicked out of the club for being queer. I hope you find a community on campus or elsewhere that affirms both your faith and your identity. You belong in the Berkeley campus community, please don’t let that club’s discrimination prevent you from seeking your group here."
"**Clubs will honestly not impact your future career.**

My experience to give some credibility: I'm a Berkeley alum in software engineering. I have interviewed with hundreds of companies.

I'm familiar with interview feedback at a large blue-chip company and I've conducted interviews at a Series E startup. Both companies were fairly meritocratic. New grad roles especially focused on two criteria: is this person pleasant to work with; and does this person have a strong foundation with a growth mindset?

There are candidates with a long list of achievements that coded and talked well. There are candidates with similar backgrounds who failed their interviews so hard it made me cringe. There are candidates with zero internships/clubs/extracurriculars who grinded leetcode and front end web dev to get their first jobs.

Anyone can say they're the Executive Director of Cat Picture AI club. It's the skills you learn, with or without a club, such as communication, kindness, intelligence, etc. that truly matter. (If there is one benefit, clubs can be *one of many* good topics to prove one's enthusiasm for tech.) Once you're out of school and tell us your long list of college achievements, we'll say ""cool"" and then interview you like any other candidate. (I can write a whole essay on how to interview well, but others have done it. At my company, you had to answer the given question. We'd grade according to a rubric, docking or adding points for communication, alternative approaches, questions, general attitude.) None of my technical colleagues care about clubs, and I suspect many recruiters don't care after putting your resume into their system.

Clubs are intentionally selective because they are small and often just cliques. They have an *appearance* of power and prestige. Don't stress yourself out over a club. It does not matter if the Electronic Potato club rejected you. Don't conduct and accept ridiculous interviews. Yes, Berkeley applicants often worked hard on their high school clubs, and it makes sense that this competitive behavior would continue into college. It still doesn't matter.

You're only in undergrad once. **Join a club that's actually fun and fulfilling.**

"Ik these kinda posts pop up probably every recruitment cycle but ughhhhhhh. This is the only school where people fr have to jump through hoops to get into clubs, it fr shouldn't be that hard, and its all ""nepotism"" imo. Idk it just makes me sad- can't get into shit without having stuff on your resume but it's impossible to get stuff to put on your resume. Its a self desructive cycle. ","Sharing core christabn doctrines.  Did you follow up on that? That phrase is the yellow flag.

If you look at the Gospels,   core christabn doctrines re about love and acceptance,  unless you're rich or part of Roman oppression.  If you look at people yelling about core christain doctrines.it's about Old Testament law Jesus said to ignore in favor of love, or words of that pisant Paul who admitted that not only did his views differ from Jesus, but in thise cases listen to Jesus"

Some of these factors influence the seeming monoculture of consulting types that draws so much criticism, but I'm just sharing what I know (not everything that's wrong with the system).

  
Background: Every consulting club at Berkeley asks for a resume at the start of the application process, with your stats and accomplishments spelled out.  This is where someone on their executive board can see whether or not you did X science fair, had Y award, or did Z for your community.  No real way to improve this beyond the obvious, it's luck that someone in the exec views the accomplishment as 'prestigious' or did the same thing.  Best way to succeed here is min/max your high school stats.

  
Skills: After the resume round, the next step is a case interview/product interview/product challenge.  This tests your skills at the type of consulting the club conducts, and there are a few important things that go into that.  The way you present yourself, the solutions you find, and unexpectedly, the way you ask questions.  In casing, you can definitely ask right/wrong questions, so be sure to ask what gives you the most useful info during your interview.  Best way to succeed here is to run casing interviews with people you know, or ChatGPT (which I did).

  
Fit: The most subjective and controversial portion of consulting interviews.  This factor is controlled by the way you act, and can be helped if you coffee chat someone, present yourself in a unique (but not annoying/weird) way, or have a personal connection in the club.  Consulting club executive boards need an opinion on you to vouch for you, so making sure you can be remembered is important.

  
That being said, consulting is realistically difficult but not impossible to get into without the connections that so many people talk down on it for.  Without connections, I made it to the final round of a top consulting club before choosing another one and turning them down.  If you want to get in, it's basically college apps; throw your hat in the ring and see where it lands."

","Best advice on this sub. Clubs are largely decided on “vibes”, which boils down to: are you someone they want to be friends with? 

People usually want to be friends with those that are of similar life experience, which means for these clubs, (1) similar physical attractiveness, (2) similar socioeconomic status ($200K+ household income and from coastal California suburbs), and (3) similar age (18-19) and race (usually Chinese or Indian American)"

"Welcome back to school! I recently graduated and wanted to provide an honest but informed perspective of the various business clubs. These opinions are my own so definitely do your own research.

Club recruitment may seem trivial (because it is), but joining the right club can make or break the type of friend group you form, the parties you are invited to, and even the internships/job you attain.

If you feel lost or confused by the club scene, know that you’re not alone. Sproul Plaza always crawls with undifferentiated club salespeople screaming, “interested in \_\_\_?” I remember thinking, “what the f\*\*\* are consulting clubs?” Many of my floormates, however, came from Bay Area feeder schools (MSJHS, Paly, Saratoga, Lynbrook, etc.) and inherited an army of helpful upperclassmen that guided them through club recruitment. They freely received valuable advice I felt was hard to come by. This ranged from which clubs to target to what interview questions to expect. Although I eventually found my footing, I can confidently say the odds were stacked against me and will be the same for many of you. So I write this in hopes of (slightly) uplifting any fellow underdogs out there.

If I were to run the gauntlet again, some of the criteria I would evaluate clubs via:

* **Achievement**: How well do members recruit professionally, and what fields do they recruit best for? Sure, fulltime recruiting is largely an individual pursuit. But if a club consistently recruits well, that may indicate hard-working and professionally oriented members, a robust network that aided them in that journey, and a structured mentorship program to get you off the ground. If that matters to you, of course.
* **Commitment**: What is the club’s expected time commitment on a weekly basis? The standard is generally 10 hours/week, although this can vary significantly.
* **Culture**: How strong is the club’s internal culture? Every club will say their culture is strong. But to cut through the noise, the best proxy is an average members’ tenure. People vote with their feet, and if members truly care about the club, they stick around in meaningful roles. You’ll see clubs with sophomores (or even freshmen!) in leadership, and that is a huge red flag. That means juniors or seniors don’t give a crap and jump ship to focus on other endeavors. If a club’s juniors/seniors show up to events and are running the club, that means they still have a lot to learn/gain, or they just genuinely enjoy being there.
* **Development**: Will you learn a lot and get to work on interesting projects? And how well does the club train and develop its members professionally? This may come in the form of external consulting projects, structured development workshops, etc.
* **Diversity**: How diverse is the academic, ethnic, and professional makeup of the club? This rating will be relative to other clubs, given the disproportionate Asian & Business Major representation in the community. This may be the hardest to pin down accurately.

The broader club landscape and my ratings:

**Business Frats**: I cannot, in good faith, recommend you join a business frat. The pledging process – the process of joining – can be emotionally, verbally, and/or physically abusive. Unless you 100% want to pursue finance, I would advise against business frats.

**Alpha Kappa Psi (AKPsi)**

* **Achievement**: A, very strong for finance and consulting
* **Commitment**: F, literally your entire life for the first semester but that drops off after pledging
* **Culture**: C, retention is okay but some serious cultural issues similar to DSP
* **Development**: C, real learning is mostly done post-pledging in other clubs or internships
* **Diversity**: D, very little diversity in any category

**Beta Alpha Psi (BAP)**

* **Achievement**: B, mainly finance and consulting but slightly weaker recruiting results than the other two.
* **Commitment**: F, same as above
* **Culture**: C, same as above
* **Development**: C, same as above
* **Diversity**: D, same as above

**Delta Sigma Pi (DSP) / Rho Consulting / Undergraduate Business Group**

* **Achievement**: A, very strong for finance
* **Commitment**: F, same as above
* **Culture**: F, potentially worst among the business frats. They got disbanded due to excessive hazing and have unsuccessfully reformed underground a couple times (hence, the extra names).
* **Development**: C, similar to above
* **Diversity**: F, similar to above but only accepts (intended) business majors

&#x200B;

**Consulting Groups**: IMO, a legit consulting club is great for learning more about business and padding your resume with projects. All of the discussed clubs are fairly well known.

**Berkeley Consulting (BC)**: Oldest consulting club on the block and no specific type of client. Clout chasers and assholes, look no further.

* **Achievement**: A, mainly consulting with some finance and tech. Lot of Bainees this year, but recruiting success varies.
* **Commitment**: D, “pseudo-pledging” your first few semesters - 20-30 hours/week time commitment
* **Culture**: D, potentially the worst culture among consulting clubs. Some members are highly elitist and look down on other clubs and even applicants. They had a mental health workshop due to retention issues and burnout. Not classy.
* **Development**: A, in exchange for large time commitment, members come out well prepared. Projects are arguably the most robust among the clubs.
* **Diversity**: D, leadership diversity has been an issue. 5+ years without a female president. They have improved as of late.

**CMG**: Focused on big clients. They’re more under the radar but very solid as a club.

* **Achievement**: B, mainly finance and consulting. The multi-club members recruit better than CMG-only members, however.
* **Commitment**: B, 10-12 hours/week
* **Culture**: B, culture is generally good. This is where business frat kids go when they don’t like their business frat.
* **Development**: B, learning is generally good. Some very good consumer projects – Nike, Lululemon, Hydro Flask.
* **Diversity**: C, average

**Net Impact Berkeley (NIB)**: Focused on social impact with large companies or nonprofits. Overall very good vibes.

* **Achievement**: A, mainly consulting and SWE/product management. Members lowkey recruit very well.
* **Commitment**: B, 10 hours/week
* **Culture**: A, tied with TBG. Have really only heard positive things. Very social impact-heavy though in case that's not your vibe.
* **Development**: C, very good tech clients – Stripe, Lyft, GoDaddy, but not sure how legit their projects actually are.
* **Diversity**: B, above average

**The Berkeley Group (TBG):** Focused on pro bono projects with nonprofits. Overall very good vibes.

* **Achievement**: B, mainly consulting and SWE. Some members recruit very well, but the average member recruits okay.
* **Commitment**: B, 8-10 hours/week
* **Culture**: A, people are very nice and strong culture. Unfortunately, members pay out of pocket for socials because of pro bono nature, but they’ve been doing more paid projects recently.
* **Development**: B, would be an A for NGO-specific work but doesn’t have as much breadth in terms of clients. If working with nonprofits is your cup of tea, 100% would recommend.
* **Diversity**: B, same as above

**Voyager Consulting**: Focused on big clients, mostly Fortune 500s. Vibes are similar to BC but not as old and stronger reputation among other business clubs right now.

* **Achievement**: A, mainly finance and consulting. Have sent a couple to BCG and other good firms but varies by grade.
* **Commitment**: B, 10-12 hours/week
* **Culture**: C, varies a lot. Some friends really struggled socially in Voyager, but others like it. It can allegedly feel like Mean Girls. If you’re one of the mean girls, then all is well.
* **Development**: B, fairly good learning and very legit projects
* **Diversity**: B, above average

&#x200B;

**Development Clubs**:

**Berkeley Business Society (BBS**): Hybrid between a business frat and a consulting club. Used to be a stepping stone club for the clubs mentioned earlier, but they compete with consulting clubs nowadays. Fairly negative reputation.

* **Achievement**: A, mainly finance and consulting. Very good placement in big firms.
* **Commitment**: C, 15 hours/week if you’re in a project team
* **Culture**: D, people drag BBS culture pretty hard. They had a retention issue because freshmen kept joining for 1 semester just to quit and join a business frat after (they literally chose pledging over BBS lmao). So BBS forced new members (mostly freshmen in their first few weeks of classes) to sign a contract that prevented them from joining other clubs for a full year.
* **Development**: C, very cool clients, but most people I know didn’t learn a whole ton directly from the club.
* **Diversity**: F, referred to as Brown Boys Society, enough said. Send tweet.

**Berkeley Investment Group (BIG)**: The best group to join if you want to learn about investing. This may not be a good fit otherwise.

* **Achievement**: A, very strong alumni placement in finance. One of the few places you’ll see alumni consistently land buyside opportunities.
* **Commitment**: D, 20 hours/week for first semester during internship program and drops to lower amount.
* **Culture**: C, have heard mixed reviews and that it can be a bit snakey.
* **Development**: A, they run a really interesting internship program similar to an Analyst under a PM in a HF. One of the truly differentiated development programs.
* **Diversity**: C, average.

**Undergraduate Finance Association / Undergraduate Management Consulting Group (UFA/UMCG)**: What you get when members of all the clubs decide to make a joint club for extra clout. Low commitment and definitely the best network in Berkeley.

* **Achievement**: A, literally the most hardo of all the other clubs, but UFA-only members are hit/miss for recruiting.
* **Commitment**: A, 2-4 hours/week
* **Culture**: C, there really isn’t a culture tbh. A couple friend groups form, but it exists more for the network.
* **Development**: C, mentorship program, but people don’t feel bought in.
* **Diversity**: D, little to no diversity

&#x200B;

Some other well-known clubs that are probably a tier or two below:

* **180D:** Nice people, but professionalism does not seem strong.
* **ABA**: The oldest business club on campus. I consider this a “first semester club,” meaning it’s a great steppingstone to other clubs. But most people don’t stick around for very long.
* **Phi Beta Lambda (PBL)**: Knock-off ABA
* **Phoenix Consulting:** More low-key, but I’ve heard good things about the culture. Healthcare-focused, so it’s good for premed folks.
* **Venture Strategy Solutions (VSS):** Consulting club focused on startups. They’ve been ahead of the game with diversity initiatives.
* **Valley Consulting Group (VCG):** Tech consulting club focused on large tech companies and startups. Hybrid between a Blueprint/Codebase and a consulting club. Some solid SWE placement, and projects seem more legit now.

What makes you unique as an individual is what makes you special, if you’re nontraditional you should embrace it instead of succumbing to stigmas and prejudices by trying to conform.

I was looking to join one with more of social circle then just professional development stuff and was wondering what the recruiting process is like and what clubs i should look to join ",dude this is stupid advice. Like I get hating clubs and stuff but these people are going to be hanging around you for the next 2 years. You're lying to their face. They'er eventually gonna find out. it's stupid to lie to people who you want to be friends with.
"lol i was just going through CS clubs' applications and noticed that one of them, required a photo of yourself. thought it was pretty weird and could literally only be used for discrimination, what do yall think? is there some other reason?","This is stupid advice. If your end goal is getting into a club, you're not going to be able to ""fake"" being a freshman for more than 2 days after you're in. At best it'll be awkward when they find out and at worst they'll rescind your application and kick you out because you lied"
"When you search for clubs on Callink ( https://callink.berkeley.edu/organizations ) search for clubs **first** using the filter “Blue Heart Initiative Category”

All clubs labeled with a Blue Heart have open and/or minimal membership practices. 

**Only if** there is not a club under the Blue Heart category that truly doesn’t meet the experiences you want to have should you look at anything else.

As a new student or someone exploring clubs, you should get a chance to actually experience a club before finding ones to stay in long-term. Don’t waste a semester getting rejected for something “competitive.”  Applying for a club does not equate to actually experiencing what that club has to offer.

TL;DR: Give yourself a fair chance at finding a club you like. Prioritize joining clubs that have a “Blue Heart” on Callink

",why they look down on transfer?
I am currently a mechanical engineering student and I don't go to Berkeley but I am from the area so I will be there over the summer. The school I go to right now doesn't really have many engineering competition clubs so I've been mainly doing solo projects which gets lonely. Does anyone know if there are any clubs that will be active over the summer and would be willing to let me help out? Any information would be appreciated!,"advice so it doesn't feel earth shattering: clubs should be fun, not stressful. Things like this usually happen because better things are in store for you, or there are better ways you could be spending your time. Maybe it's time to revisit an old hobby or pick up a new one. Something that no one can tell you, you can't do that or you can't be apart of this, Like an instrument, skateboarding, or painting. This setback does not define you, and you deserve better. I believe life will give you something far better and more fulfilling.  Keep your focus on yourself, your health, and your wealth. Carry on."
I was wondering if there was a more casual boxing club for those of us who just want to do it for an hour or 2 every week/what the options were,"your life is over. these club decisions directly determine your first job, all subsequent jobs, your future net worth, your chances of ever finding love, and your value as a human being. 

it is most certainly **not** a bunch of your-age-plus-one year olds deciding you’re not cool enough to hang out with them. certainly not that."
"Why tf are the tech clubs at Berkeley so selective? What’s the point? I get that so many people apply and it’s hard to accommodate everyone but fuck not getting into a single club after pouring hours of work into coffee chatting, info sessions, and club apps all the while trying to balance your clubs. I just wasted a ginormous amount of time and get nothing in return. Got to the final round of web dev and got rejected after a BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEW, come on man, and I thought the interview went amazing, we were vibing and all, wtf is the point of having a social before you even get into the club, people be acting like you’re already part of the club and the next day you find out you’re rejected. Man I’ve been tryna find experience to add to my resume, been toiling for hours, can’t get an internship for the life of me after mass applying for days, and when I try to bulk up my resume, I can’t because this shit happens. Well I just had to let that out. Sorry for the rant","Alumni bear here. Never knew about consulting when in undergrad. Was MCB and Public Health. 

Learned later in grad school what it was, how consulting works, and made it through multiple case interviews at Deloitte, McKinsey, BCG, and boutique firms. 

Then realized I could leverage my network, didn’t really want to work for someone else and started my own firm before I was 30 (focus on organizational design and change management) and cleared mid six figures running things the way I want (no all-nighters for stupid PowerPoint decks that don’t go anywhere, rolling up my sleeves and working across all levels of the organization from frontline staff to being the EC for the csuite, etc)

Point being, when I was an undergrad, I heard my friends freak out about Haas and consulting club interviews. I promise it will mean so little in the future, and honestly now that I do know about it, find it so infuriating how elitist this is. Find alumni who work at the companies you’re interested in and reach out. You just need one to believe in you and be willing to mentor/sponsor you. Don’t let this club hold you back. Opportunities are made, no point in fighting with everyone else for the same ones."
"i already have a lot of internship (could end up getting full time) and research experience on my resume and started applying since freshman spring but i yet to get in one of them, can i still apply and would i have a good chance or is it a waste of time lol + i am also asian",why did you have to apply again
"Is there an actuary club at Berkeley? I seem to remember there being one. I went to Sproul today to look for their table, but I couldn't find it. The information online seems to be out of date","Once you spend a year or two in the ""real world"" after university, you'll see how meaningless these status games are. 


There are soooo many opportunities at Cal, clubs are only one of many."
"are there any casual clubs for undergrads for people interested in recreational investing to just talk about economic news, stock picks, etc? not a grindy pre-IB club with 4 rounds of interviews, just a club for people who want to talk about investing and learn from each other? ","I will write a post about my experience with clubs on a post soon to share my view and perspective. But as a person who’s run successful businesses, is friends with tech CEO’s, and top executives I can tell you there is nothing these clubs can offer you that you can’t find on your own. In fact, doing it on your own will make you a better candidate in my opinion for a lot of jobs. No hiring manager is holding slots for people just because they were in a club and having “connections” doesn’t exist unless the person you know is a top level executive. Take this opportunity to lock in and surpass these people, because at the end of the day these aren’t your friends they are your competition for jobs. You have been around them long enough to know their strengths and weaknesses so now use that to your advantage and adapt!"
"I have thrown events in the past in other cities around the Bay but want to give Berkeley a go. However I am not all that connected to the night scene in Berkeley so was hoping to get some help! 

I am looking to have a Boiler Room/Dance Party type of thing. Would love to get some recommendations on clubs to reach out to or if anyone knows of any warehouses that are available to use. Nothing like a super big nightclub probably around the size of a classroom more or less. Built in sound systems or a bar that can serve their own alcohol are pluses but not necessary. Thanks!","gave up on consulting clubs they beg for useless projects from big companies to show off the logos 😭 they just do a whole bunch of bullshit and be intimidating about it 😁 anyone can be a consultant it’s just solving other peoples and company problems so just go about life and develop your interests, i swear 9/10 times you can consult for any major (literally even an art consultant for a building or residential place or whatever) 

this is getting a bit personal cause i was caught up in applying to consulting clubs too but biz majors have classes like “leading people” bffr you don’t need to learn that at a school rather be taking sociology or psychology and get the same effect i promise you they all just leverage the network later on with the club alumni

there are so many other clubs on campus that are much more welcoming and not elitist where you can contribute to actual causes and interests you care about over resume workshopping and making a slide deck the company doesn’t even care about :)"
Is there a resource where I can find past interview questions for specific clubs in Berkeley?,"People are right it's not a big deal for your future, but it's clear if you know all these people then you must bug people. Either talk too much or or too little or don't play well on a team. How do you do in other groups?"
is there a car club at cal? ,"alumni bear here i graduated this past may: don’t worry about it trust me. during my undergrad i realized a lot of consulting clubs at berkeley have a very cult like personality and they pick and choose at their own will. there is no logic behind it and the faster you understand that, the happier you are going to be. 

when i was a junior i applied to a club (i was already president of another club not consulting) but my friends wanted me to do it for fun, after the first interview i didn’t get in and i felt like a loser. fast forward to summer i got this internship and job at a good brand and that following fall that SAME club and another consulting club reached out to me begging me to partner with them. what i did was i decided to join the other club for fun and they didn’t even accept me 🤣 even though they were begging to partner and consult for my brand and asking me to be the middle man? (also my company did not give a shit about their consulting projects because we were actually focused on making revenue and not wasting time) after rejecting me, they still didn’t leave me for over a year😭 they would constantly ask me on linkedin and send me emails asking for partnering opportunities. this just goes on to show how desperate and pathetic sometimes they are. i was literally working for a brand already that they were BEGGING to partner with and they didn’t want to be around a person like me whom they might get jealous of because stating facts, I was already doing what they wanted to do in their future. im sharing my story because its super funny to me how consulting clubs on campus seem like an important factor in your career when they aren’t. be true to yourself, join clubs that resonate with your passion, do side projects, companies care more about that. heck yeah even cold email companies asking for project opportunities as an undergrad. this is a blessing in disguise and now you can stay away from these clubs and actually focus on your own life and career because tbh those clubs don’t do much but suck your soul. if you ever need advice, im happy to help!"

"Would anyone be interested in starting up a club that focuses on theme parks? A lot of universities have clubs that do ride design projects, discuss different parts of the themed entertainment industry, bring in guest speakers, go on field trips, and other stuff regarding anything from roller coaster engineering to live concerts to escape rooms. They’re great for engineering, architecture, and theater majors, and really anyone with an interest in theme parks. If anyone wants to try and start one, DM me!","This stuff is such b.s. Why don’t they just have bigger clubs? Or more clubs? Granted, rejection is an important life lesson, but there are plenty of other opportunities to learn about that."
always remember clubs here are NOT a measure of your professional or personal growth as someone who’s been through recruitment season four times!,"A lot of the people who were interviewing you have never had an internship, yet are the arbiters of who is allowed into their club or not. Berkeley clubs are a lot of nonsense, especially the ones deemed prestigious. Just find another one that appreciates you. I promise you whatever opportunities you had in that club are not exclusive to it."
hey all! i applied as a math major and was wondering what clubs/programs yall recommend that take transfer students. had a counseling meeting today and my counselor said it was something to look into.,Clubs at Berkeley might just be the most bullshit thing on planet earth - they don’t mean anything after school or even during school.

I'm a freshman this year at Berkeley and was just wondering which consulting clubs are known to be the best ones bc there's way too many of them and I wanna figure out which infosessions to go to.

"I could find any booth related to sports last week.
Aren't they recruiting?
I want to get into table tennis club.","I was flabbergasted to learn joining a club at Cal has become so competitive.  As an alumni who does a good amount of hiring let me tell you this …. these clubs have a minuscule (or zero) impact on you getting a job.  Yes it looks good to have a well rounded resume, but that can easily be done with volunteering with an organization that may or may not be associated with Cal.  There is so much need in the East Bay.  People need help with all sorts of things … help school kids with math or science, volunteer at a homeless shelter, volunteer at the SPCA, get involved at a local environmental group.  Help organize events.  Look for opportunities to lead an initiative with these organizations.

Honestly Cal was MUCH BETTER when we had affirmative action.  Kids today at Cal are too round up.  It’s not good to have everyone on the same mind set of achieve-achieve-achieve!  Slow down.  My god get high and have a few drinks!   Do kids even have fun anymore?!?  Clubs are supposed to be extracurricular activities.  Heck do what my friend did and CREATE your own club.  Looks way better on a resume.

And to go back to my original point, all your extracurriculars barely get glanced at.  It’s sort of a high/medium/low assessment.   I see this person went to Cal (most notable), they have a degree in X (second most notable), and I see a medium amount of words under activities (least important).  

Then of course when you get “real” experience the entire education section of your resumes gets demoted in importance even further.  Sure the institution and degree still matter but they are more there to round out story of you … “Here is a gal who has 4 years of experience as a Data Scientist at X company, oh BTW and I see she went to Cal, that tracks, and I’ll put her a little higher in a pile of people with similar experience, but she is still lower than those with more relevant experience and career accomplishments.”  At this point your activities associated with Cal become even less important."
"Does anyone know if there’s any baking/cooking clubs on campus? I used to work as a baker and cake decorator and I’ve really been missing it recently.

"TechRank exists for a couple of reasons: 

\- To help applicants decide where to apply. All tech clubs say they are the best, all of them claim to offer great experiences and friendship. But which of them actually do? That question is what TechRank aims to answer. I want to reward the best clubs - the ones that aren't elitist, the ones that legitimately have fun socials and promote bonds between their members - by encouraging people to apply to them.

\- To encourage clubs to improve their culture. I know club leaders see this ranking. The last two have gotten over 30k views, and I want clubs to try to improve their ranking by improving the experience for the people in them.

\- To encourage potential new club-starters to go ahead and start those new clubs. There is more demand for these sorts of tech clubs than there is supply, the acceptance rates for many clubs is below 5%. So by all means, go start new clubs! Several of the clubs on this list were started in the past few years, you do not have to have existed for 20 years to be a good tech club.

\- Because it's fun, and ranking things is more fun than writing reviews of every club. 

&#x200B;

TechRank does not exist for some other reasons:

\- To perpetuate the elitism that is, unfortunately, present in many tech clubs. The idea is to call out elitism when it appears - the top clubs here should be those that are the most inclusive, and least elitist.

\- To say that tech clubs with low admission rates are the only way that CS majors can find friends, gain experience with projects, or have a good time at Berkeley. This is not true! There are many happy students who aren't in any of these clubs. But at the same time, there are also a lot of happy students who are in these clubs! TechRank is for the people who want the experience of being in these clubs.

&#x200B;

In short, TechRank is for people who want something like TechRank, and not for people who don't. If you don't like that it exists, feel free to scroll past. I would say not to downvote, if only so that people who do want it can see it, but I am well aware that people do not often avoid downvoting posts because the posts say ""please don't downvote this"". 

&#x200B;

So without further ado, let's begin with the thing you probably clicked on this post for: **TechRank 2024**.

&#x200B;

**Honorable mentions, alphabetical order:** Datagood, DataStory, Extended Reality @ Berkeley, Neurotech @ Berkeley, Political Computer Science

&#x200B;

**Format: Club Name (ranking change since 2023, ranking in 2023)**

&#x200B;

**14) Open Project (prev: unranked)**

Open Project is unique in that they theoretically accept everyone, as long as you show interest in the club. They just got started last year, and have had a relatively successful first year, but aren't going to go up in the rankings too much until they show stability over a couple of years. That said, they have a good mission and are a great example of the idea that you don't have to do what all the other clubs are doing. 

&#x200B;

**13) Big Data @ Berkeley (-1, prev: 12)**

Big Data is a club that exists - hard to say too much more about them. If you join, you'll probably get the ""tech club experience,"" which is more than can be said about some other clubs - they have a retreat, socials, work, etc. But it's hard to say what they actually do, and no one in my survey mentioned them. So this is probably the ranking I'm least sure of, as I'm not sure what the BDAB experience really consists of, whereas most of the other clubs higher up on this list have more defined experiences.

&#x200B;

**12) Blockchain @ Berkeley (-4, prev: 8)**

Having money is not the only thing that makes a club good. B@B has money, to be sure, but they were described by many people in my survey as the club that had gotten worse the fastest over the past year. Other clubs often don't want to host cross-club socials with them due to complaints about their lack of responsibility, they often get the cops called on them at socials and retreats, and they have a culture that was generally described as toxic. Although there are members still genuinely interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, they are being driven out by people fitting the ""crypto bro"" stereotype who are mainly in the club to spend the club's money. 

&#x200B;

**11) MDB (-1, prev: 10)**

Last year, Mobile Developers of Berkeley was ranked 10th, as survey respondents claimed the club was socially dead, had lost focus, and many had left. There was some improvement in the first half of the year, but that improvement came at the cost of spending most of their saved money on socials, leading to a significant decline in the second half of the year. While they will probably exist for a while longer, it's clear that MDB needs change if they're going to regain the status they have had in the past. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that most people in the club don't actually want to do mobile development, but they've lost a lot of the interest of their members that they had in years past.

&#x200B;

**10) DSS (prev: unranked)**

Data Science Society, or DSS, has a strong member experience. They aren't the best in every category, as the DSS members who filled out my survey would have you believe, but they've certainly made an impact on many of their members. They've existed for a long time, and though they went through some tough times during COVID, they've improved their culture a lot since then. They have a wholesome environment and if you're into data science, they're a good place to be.

&#x200B;

**9) PlexTech (+2, prev: 11)**

PlexTech has an F grade name and an A grade budget. Their culture leaves something to be desired - certainly they have cool events and trips to Hawaii, but most of the members aren't truly committed the same way that they are to some other clubs. Their ratio of active members to people who are in the club just for the socials is fairly low, meaning that their budget might not be as sustainable as that of some other clubs. But PlexTech is a pretty new club, and they've been making a lot of progress since 2022, when they weren't even on the list. Look for them to rise up the ranks in the future, if they make the right decisions. 

&#x200B;

**8) ANova (-1, prev: 7)**

ANova hasn't changed a whole lot since last year. They are still committed to their mission of teaching middle schoolers to code, and they still have a strong culture (though, with less parties than it appeared last year). ANova is still a great club to join if you want to have an impact on the world instead of just making money. 

&#x200B;

**7) SAAS (+2, prev: 9)**

The Student Association for Applied Statistics, or SAAS for people who don't feel like pronouncing that many syllables, has continually improved its social experience each of the past two years and is the best data science club on campus. They were ranked 15th in 2022, but they should be highlighted here as a group that spent time trying to improve their culture, and succeeded. It doesn't hurt that they have gotten some well-known clients and have been able to afford some pretty fun events (retreats, yachts, etc). Overall, they have good vibes and I definitely see them moving up even farther in the future. They're also among the largest clubs on this list with around 100 members, which makes them a good test case to see if clubs this big can really form the same community as smaller clubs like the ones that make up most of the top 5.

&#x200B;

**6) WDB (-1, prev: 5)**

WDB, or Web Developers of Berkeley, is a bit of an interesting case. Their social culture has remained pretty strong. They continue to host parties, they definitely posted the link to my survey in their club chat and got a bunch of people to rate them really high, and their members continue to be active within the club. But on other fronts, the WDB experience has gotten worse since last year. Their culture was described last year by one person as ""work hard, play hard,"" but now they seem to just be ""play hard,"" which has impacted their budget and general environment. They have a pretty strong big-little program (mentioned by more than one person), and people don't seem to be leaving yet, but it's unclear whether they can maintain this culture in the future, given the lack of interest in actually doing web development.

&#x200B;

**5) ML@B (-1, prev: 4)**

ML@B drops here one spot because they weren't quite as successful at improving their social culture as they wanted to be last year. They're certainly one of the smartest clubs on campus, and if you are interested in doing ML research there are not many better places to be. But they haven't quite attained the same social culture that some of the top clubs, and even the up-and-comers have. They have money, and they manage it well - their culture is not toxic, and it's a fun club to be in. Machine learning isn't going anywhere, and neither is ML@B.

&#x200B;

**4) Launchpad (-2, prev: 2)**

The other machine learning club, Launchpad has maintained their strong community and traditions, and has more socials than ML@B. What drops Launchpad here is that their culture isn't quite as unified as it once was. There are more cliques now than there used to be, and the club tends to have a very specific culture that it's great if you fit in with, but unfortunately, not everyone fits in. The professional experience is strong if you want it to be, and Launchpad is a great place for a specific kind of person. If you want to get in, you basically need to be a freshman or sophomore (despite what they'll tell you), so make sure you apply early in your Berkeley career. 

&#x200B;

**3) Codebase (+3, prev: 6)**

Perhaps it was a little hasty to drop Codebase from the top 5 last year. Codebase is still the prototypical Berkeley tech club - generic name, incredibly low acceptance rate, pretentious-sounding website - but they've improved their social experience a decent amount since last year while getting rid of the strange crypto projects and replacing them with legitimate projects (that pay quite a lot of money). Codebase remains one of the top clubs at Berkeley, though there are still concerns. They often try to cut potential members off from other clubs - they've tried to give ""exploding offers"" in the past, as well as enforce that new members can't join any other clubs in the same semester. If you join Codebase, it's harder to slack off than in a lot of other clubs - they get a lot of money because they are doing the work for it. If you want to work hard, but get rewarded for it, Codebase is a good place for you.

&#x200B;

**2) Blueprint (+1, prev: 3)**

Blueprint was mentioned by many people, even those from other clubs, as one of the most inclusive and wholesome clubs on campus. And it makes sense - people who join Blueprint, a club about creating tech for non-profits, are generally interested in helping out the world. They might not have the largest budget, because they do pro bono work, but if you want to join a community, not just go to Hawaii, Blueprint is a great choice. They've even established chapters across the nation, which is not something that an unstable club would do. It's very hard to get accepted, but it's a great place to be if you do.

&#x200B;

**1) Codeology (--, prev: 1)**

Codeology is, for the second straight year, the top-ranked tech club at Berkeley. They may not have the largest budget, but they have the strongest community, and other clubs should strive to model their commitment to member experience, learning, and bonding. Codeology is well known for their member buy-in, which is strong enough that for members in multiple tech clubs, nearly all of them choose Codeology as their favorite. They're not perfect, of course - no club is. Their interview process can be a bit frustrating. They have a ridiculous number of people on their officer board. But if you're looking for the tech club experience, and you get into Codeology (easier said than done), look no further than the avocado.

"Title.

There doesn’t seem to be a club on campus dedicated to watching and discussing movies socially. I’m interested in starting one up.

If you’re interested too, send me a DM. I’m also planning to set up an executive board of equally motivated people (co-presidents, vice president, marketing director, secretary, and treasurer—so six including myself).

I am a transfer student (started Fall 2023) and an Env. Econ major. I am not in any consulting clubs and was wondering if I even have a shot at getting in.

I just want more experience to prepare before my internship starts. If time is an issue, I graduate in the Fall 2025 semester. So I have a year and a half left at Berkeley.

You're better off joining a club that's closer to your actual interests or just doing professional development on your own. Otherwise you won’t have time for the things you care about.

Have your friend who lives there ask the building management for any written policies about reserving lounges and common outdoor spaces for private use. 

Generally, those spaces are supposed to be for the use of all of the residents of the building. I don't know about that building in particular.  

But those types of buildings get their development permits from the City based on their representations of what will be provided in the buildings--and one of the things they often represent is ""useable open space"" for the residents, like rooftop decks, and lounges. 

It's one thing if a resident has a birthday party or something in a lounge--it's another if the lounges / roof decks are being regularly taken away from the majority of the residents for use by outside groups (regardless of whether a member of that group lives in the building.)"

"So you got rejected by a club at Berkeley. Probably in tech or consulting. They made you write essays, maybe gave you an interview, and still ended up throwing out your application. Whatever happened, it didn't end like you wanted. 

The question now is - what are you going to do about it? You have a couple of options.

Option 1: Complain. You could write a post on Reddit complaining about how unfair it is that clubs at Berkeley are so selective. You'll get plenty of upvotes, because you're right. It is unfair. You'll get a temporary serotonin boost when other people comment telling you how they also got rejected from the club they applied to. 

Option 2: Beat the system. Next semester you'll have the opportunity to apply to clubs again. Take any advice you can find and use it to get into one of those fancy tech clubs that has a retreat every semester and a new member program (no experience necessary!) and nice jackets for all the members and all the other things they brag about in their infosession. You'll have fun, meet a lot of people, and learn about designing machine learning programs on the blockchain or whatever. 

Option 3: Break the system. You made it into UC Berkeley. That means something, right? Go out and start your own consulting club that accepts everyone. Make a club that only takes people who were rejected by another club. Found a tech club that's purely social. Create a consulting club that only gives bad advice. Start a petition to make it easier to start clubs. Do something about the problem and make some actual change. Everyone knows the problem exists - so help fix it!","I live in hope that one day people with that sort of attitude pull it on the wrong person (i.e. someone they're about to be interviewing with).

,Bro we’re still talking about snooroar? 😭
,"Awhile back I read what was basically his life story where he explains why he does it. He describes being very cynical and overly sensitive since he was a child. He never socialized with anyone for the entirety of K-12. He got in trouble often due to his distrustful nature and emotional outbursts, so he decided to cut himself off socially early on to avoid being reprimanded. His parents never corrected his behavior at home and he avoided counseling at school, so this went completely unchecked for his entire life. As time went on, he started to become obsessed with succeeding and having the ""best"" academic experience possible. 

In HS he discovered reddit—the first social/emotional outlet he felt comfortable with, and he has been posting ever since.

So, I don't think it's fair to just label him a ""troll."" He is an obsessive person with 0 social kills and unchecked mental illness. Also as far as I know, he doesn't actually pretend to be from Berkeley, but just posts on several university subreddits to vent about his college experience in general. 

I don't doubt that he sometimes posts with genuine ill intent and has some really twisted views, but it seems unfair simply to lump him with common trolls when he clearly needs some serious help."

,That's not how socializing works. Life long community is not compatible with putting in low effort. Nobody wants to hang out with a flake.

,Where did everyone’s sense of humor go
,three rounds of interviews + two coffee chats + formal dress code + “social round” for volunteer experience 🫩 my lab had a 20 min interview lol

,"If it's that competitive, it will get you ready for job interviews where you get ghosted left and right."
,Lol bro I got zero interviews. Just straight resume-rejected across the board.
,"I got rejected by around 10 CS/DS clubs my sophomore year despite spending hours on applications. Joined the furry club, still got an internship, and haven't looked back since :3"
,"Alumni here, what the heck is up with all this club talk these days? What happened to the Squirrel Fishing Club, or Cal Fencing?

Is every club now some consulting club? Go join Cal Band (ha, especially if you have friends at ACC schools).

Go enjoy your college time. You have a lot of time to work work after you graduate."
,"I know the feeling, and I know it sucks. You worked hard, you cared, you did your best, and it doesn't seem like you got anything from it. But that's not entirely true. You got experience with interviews, you made connections, you developed your skills, and you put yourself out there. Growth mindset. This will help you for next time, and if you got far for many of them, maybe there'll be an opening soon and you'll get in to one, you never know.

And in the long run, clubs aren't everything. I didn't join any while I was at Berkeley and my career is going super well. But maybe clubs aren't as important in EECS."
,"It literally doesn’t matter babe, promise."
,"I can’t fathom why people stress over clubs. They’re a massive circlejerk of juniors and seniors with a power trip who will end up work in the exact same places as the people they rejected. And this is coming from someone who was in multiple clubs and knows people who were the heads of clubs. Chances are even the most “prestigious” clubs will have a basically nonzero boost in getting a job or grad school apps. The only advantage is potentially getting referrals but even then you don’t need to be in a club for that, you can literally just ask random people on Blind lol. 

(Note this is for CS, not sure about consulting but I know plenty of people who got into haas or top consulting jobs without ever being in a club)"
,chill bro. At least u got interviews
,"As an alumnus, I don’t understand what these “clubs” people are “applying to” are. 

Go join a club that’s just a neat hobby and show up. Go take some art classes. Go for a hike. Go make some friends that are completely outside of your major and career path. Spend your non-studying time enjoying life and making friends. 

I don’t get this weird club hustle and I sincerely hope it’s just one tiny subset of whatever is going on socially at cal."
,"Old fart here. Why does it matter? In my day (over two decades ago) the only club I remember being selective was the business frat and that seemed lame as hell as far as I could tell.

Why do you think you need these?

I'm a scientist so maybe I don't have insight into some types of careers where hyper-networking is critical."
,"me too since i already have done and been through the same process and results 2 semesters straight in a row now (sophomore), but at the end of the day, it is what it is. it sucks but clubs aren’t as important than you think it is. i was still able to get internships as a freshman cs major when i applied at the time and even of some ghosted me which was literally worse than these club rejections so don’t worry about these clubs! its just mainly for the social aspect!"
,Pro Tip: No one in the real world cares about college clubs.
,"I went through the exact same cycle you’re describing for my first three semesters and it ruined the first two weeks every sem. I only became happier after I stopped pursuing these clubs and my self worth wasn’t tied to this rat race. 

It was one thing to not get past a case round but it hurts more when you get rejected at the social round because you’re like damn I’m smart but they just don’t like me as a person and it’s all because you didn’t lube up xyz members who want to pull their friends into the club anyway.

Before you say it prepares you for the real world, internship and full time recruiting has been much easier than the hellish spiral these clubs put you through. At least you’re not performing for so called “actives” who are your peers but treat you like filthy entertainment."
,which clubs did you apply to?
,You still got internship and full time job applications bro
,felt this. ur not alone.

,"That's what you get for being a rear smooching clown.

What you can do instead is create your own club. 
Now, it's likely that no one will bother joining but at the very least you can have that under your name."
,"Did you TRY though? We often want something but do we deserve it? If you were rejected that only means everyone else who didn't get rejected tried HARDER than you.

Where is your pride? Do you know the meaning of being number one because you worked harder than everyone else? THAT IS MY PRIDE."
,"CS clubs are completely useless professionally. I never bothered applying to them, didn't hold me back whatsoever."
,"Just join afx tbh. You’ll make great connections. Get those future lawyer and doctor friends, and future CS recommendations"

,"at the same time, you also have old posts talking about applying for FAFSA economic hardship (loan deferment?) as well as making 150k before going back to school, which while a legitimate accomplishment does not exactly make you a gilded age business mogul either"

,"Welcome to Berkeley. It can be like that. I too was sad to find out that the student populace here was still very much human. But some of them are pretty rad, so rad they make up for all the pretentious, clique, holier-than-thou brats you’ll most certainly run into while you’re here.

I wish you all the luck."
,"From what I've seen you won't be missing much. 


It's an elitist circle-jerking clique culture focused on building useless decks and PowerPoints (copy and pasted with the help of ChatGPT) that no one and not even the firm you're trying to represent cares about only in hopes of getting a job interview after graduation. 


They did you a favor by rejecting you, you'll be saving a ton of energy and stress not being apart of that mess.


If you're a business or econ major, intern independently with a local business and see how you like it. You only need one person, one company to give you a chance to help mentor and give you the networking skills needed post-graduation.


And if you ignore everything I just said and still want to go to those toxic clubs, remember you're only a freshman and you have 3 years left.


Chin up, eyes forward."
,"as someone who went through multiple cycles of that BS and eventually got into it quite late, don't give a shit about it. Don't bother getting involved in a club unless you already know the people in that club for future cycles. Don't be a loner this year and use every avenue other than clubs to make friends. Be involved in stuff outside of the clubs as much as possible."
,Apply to YC with a start up
,"Join the social clubs, meet new people and enjoy. Some of these consulting clubs are a nice way to meet people but the amount you have to put in is not worth the roi. 80% of the clubs I have seen either only take super smart people who are already destined for greatness, or are ran by a bunch of power-hungry students with no background/relevent experience just wanting to see who has the largest dick."
,"Join social clubs, look at URAPs, apply for whatever appeals to you. CalLink has all the clubs listed. There's a filter for clubs with no application process and you can join something fun. Look for opportunities outside Cal, too. You're not behind by not making a consulting club. Internships exist, too. Look at the Discovery Hub. You can sign up for them to email you all the things that pop up as your interests. They will show up on a rolling basis.

You can also look at micro internships. They are short term opportunities that businesses are looking for someone to do a specific task and will pay you. Berkeley Career Engagement can hook you up. Just start pivoting."

,eecs internship fair this year attracted more students than the ng one. We’re so cooked at this point lmao.
,you go to berkeley. you'll be okay lol
,"Disclaimer. Didn’t read. Went to Haas. I make nearly 200k a year already and graduated in ‘19. Life’s good. Oh yeah, I dodged tf out of these consulting clubs. College goes by way too fast to waste time on this."
,"Alumni who works in finance and did a stint in consulting.  Employers do not care about this stuff.  They also don’t care about Greek life.  Connections only matter it’s your immediate friends with power.  Both these fields are rife with nepotism so unless your parents or your best friend’s parents are the hiring board you should join one for friends, help with interviews, job exposure or boredom.

Also this wasn’t a thing 20 years ago and we would have called these club dork squads."
,Do you have to be a business major to be apart of these?
,are you employed by chance?
,"Oh my god, why would anyone waste their time with these. Get good professional experience, do things on your own instead of piggybacking off a “club”, and ACTUALLY network with REAL professionals to get your advice, instead of these wannabe IB kids who don’t know what WLB stands for and will endlessly chase prestige until depression.

EDIT: On a side note, this list was arranged very beautifully. The MD at Goldman will LOVE to have you reformat PPTs at 2AM."
,Entrepreneurs at Berkeley is not a consulting club!
,"hey  man, you should join the blue heart initiatives (no interview or coffee chat or anything).  Imo professional clubs are largely a waste of time and you're better off applying to internships or volunteering.  Sorry to hear that though the professioanl clubs are very toxic, many times I've spoken to people at their events and when i say im a transfe tey lowk just walk away"

,"This is a hard truth (and confirmed by many of my transfer friends), but a lot of clubs / people at Berkeley discriminate against transfer students. There is a stigma against transfer students, even if people don't say it out loud.

A lot of clubs stop recruiting students once they're no longer freshmen/sophomores due to the limited amount of time they can be in the club. It takes 1 semester to train and they don't think it's worth their time if they can find other people who will be in their club longer.

This sucks, but there's nothing you can do about it. These clubs have hundreds of applications and they have the ability to choose. There's a lot of Blue Heart initiative clubs (check out Callink) that accept everyone who joins; you may wanna check out those clubs instead.

For all of those people who are downvoting you, they can fuck off. Your question / post is valid, and the transfer stigma does unfortunately exist / is a harsh reality that most people don't realize."

,"I mean take my advice with a grain of salt but from what I’ve seen and heard from friends in the consulting community, BC and BBS have fallen off in terms of projects and placements. They have just been riding off their reputation and name but you are better off choosing a consulting club where you genuinely like the community and could see yourself spending four years of your college career with them. Like a lot of people in this community say, consulting clubs are really not that deep and a lot of the overhyped prestigious clubs have a lot of assholes.

That said, a lot of clubs are known to have great communities. I’ve heard great things about ppl in NIB, 180, Venture, TBG, etc. If all you want is the name on your resume, BC is probably still your best bet? But not as good as you think anymore from what I can tell."
,"Literally just apply to the clubs you like and join the one with an environment that you believe suits you. At the end of the day, networking and actual internship matter more than your club (all should have good alumni networks). The rankings are literally pointless because even if club A is ""better"" than club B what real difference does it make?"
,"Daughter is part of a consulting club. Not one of the super competitive or well known ones, but that’s fine with her (and me). She joined with her friends and to make new friends and I think it’s been good for her to learn how to take on certain responsibilities, to speak and interact with people, and to do certain projects. It’s a win win situation as long as the group you’re with is a good group who learns how to work together and tries to just get experience with networking and learning how to be responsible. 

It’s like anything else in college, it’s a good tool to learn, mature, and to grow."

Berkeley didn't allow drinking and dancing in the same room until 1960. 

The city really doesn't want a nightlife, and they don't give permits to anything like a club, and all the bars have to close early.

That's why there are so many great bars and pubs exactly on the Albany/Berkeley border.

You're going to have to hit up Oakland or SF. That's the only real nightlife in the Bay Area."

Call it cope, but I find consulting/cs/ds clubs to be cliquey and self aggrandizing. Also, have fun getting in if you aren’t Asian/White/know somebody."
,"hey there!! i’m a former exec in one of the three ds clubs you listed, would advise getting a coffee chat (they take notes afterwards, so be prepared for your coffee chat) and go to an infosession (they take attendance). 

yes, now that you’ve taken data 100 i would advise you to aim at higher entry level positions. and there are no easier ds clubs to get in, the sheer amount of people applying makes all of them pretty difficult to get in

i would say though as an ex-member of a ds club who joined for two years and got pretty high up in the ladder, i didn’t find much meaning in being a part of one of these clubs. i had a very hard time vibing authentically with these people and making genuine friends. i suppose that’s what happens when the prerequisite for getting in these type of clubs are cutthroat, and this type of competition attracts cliquey people. i would advise getting involved in research like urap or cdss discovery for cool projects."

Yea dawg that's almost every damn club on campus ESPECIALLY consulting clubs lmfao 😂 Almost every club social activity has drinking and drugs at their internal events... Welcome to college lol

The sad reality you'll never really ""fit in"" or be ""that guy"" if you're not comfortable with doing any of these things, and that's fine. You can still join the club, do your job, and just not go to the social events. Hazing exists but not nearly as bad as the frats

If you're anywhere from slightly to insanely narcissistic and like flexing staying at 5 star hotels, ""business"" dinners at Michelin restaurants, and racking up a shit ton of miles and status with airlines all on the company's dime after graduating, consulting is perfect for you

and yes, basically every club on campus will take non-freshmen, so don't worry about that"
,"Depends on how competitive the clubs are.  Premed should be less cut throat, but consulting and finance clubs here are definitely very selective with most people just doing 1-2.  For a lot of clubs, I know it is general members and then a light process to join the committee like a chill interview."
,"Vibes, how attractive you are, nepotism, resume. 

In that order."
,"I was in a consulting club and helped run the recruitment process:
- application stage: how good your essays are, as in it shows actual interest and isn’t generic, resume helps
- interviews: basically, don’t be an asshole, we look for behavioral red flags in how you talk and interact with others, and we do actually grade you on your casing (it’s at least 50% of your score) both on getting the right answer and how you approach the problem even if you don’t get it right

,"you're not missing out on much -- most clubs at berkeley that require an application are more likely to accept people who are connected with existing members.

,"(I've been promoting this a lot 😭, but here we go again...)

I'm in two clubs that have CS projects to work on and would be happy to take you!

1)Pioneers in Engineering builds and runs a robotics competition for local high schools at a low cost to the 15-20 schools that participate annually.We have three software teams:

* Dawn: builds the code editor the HS students use to program their robots
* Runtime: writes programs pertaining to the network of student computers, motors, servos, & competition code
* Shepherd: creates field control software - automates part of the competition. (e.g. last year, when the high schooler's robots were able to press a combination of buttons in a row, their scoreboard automatically updated. The buttons lit up in the order they were supposed to be pressed, and if the high schooler pressed the wrong button/took too long to complete the task, the game would disable itself for a period of time.)

To join, fill out the form on [https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/getInvolved/Forms](https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/getInvolved/Forms). Work sessions are Wednesdays 7-9pm (& some meet Saturdays 1-3pm), but attendance every time is not required.

&#x200B;

2) OpenProject (see [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10p9dxv/rejected_again_follow_up_to_the_follow_up/) for its origins): they have 15 projects in different areas such as DS/data engineering, web dev, mobile dev, AI, NLP. Once you fill out the form ranking your project preferences you're in. HOWEVER, bc they had problems with inactive members last semester, they decided to require this sem that anyone joining the club had to go to one Info Session & one Meet & Greet. Those events alr passed, & the project preference form is due today. So either you email them reassuring them you will be an active member & want to participate this sem, or you wait until next sem, when they will take you."

,Getting into a cs club has a lower acceptance rate than college let alone any internship. It’s not even comparable lol

,"I relate to the part of not really having done anything my freshman year (I’m a sophomore now too). I would say to check out the clubs that don’t require any application/that u can just show up to, the people there tend to be pretty chill and nice to talk to! Join an IM sport team too as a free agent if ur interested, it is a good way to make friends (or at least have a circle you see at least once a week)."

,"If Cal would pay more, I’m sure they wouldn’t get evicted. This is how it works everywhere in the world, sometimes prices go up, and if you don’t pay the prices, you don’t get to keep the service."
,"Take this with a grain of salt as when I was there there was no four year program so everyone was applying sophomore year or transfers. I think that does matter as there’s probably way more limited space given an entire new category of students at haas which means things may be more competitive than they were before.

The advice I got was that they want applicants to showcase their four pillars as well as want an applicant to show that they will be successful with or without the program. Essentially, what they want to see is that you’re engaged and have a plan for yourself that you believe the curriculum it has will help you with, not that the name brand of the program will make or break your path. In simple terms would taking an introduction to private equity class actually help you for your own career ambitions, not convince you to go into private equity. Given that at least when I applied, it seemed like the traditional accounting, banking, consulting students didn’t do as well in applications compared to students who did more fun clubs, or unique clubs, but showed leadership potential. Essentially, it seemed like kids who ran the anime club for example and wrote about that experience typically grabbed Application readers more than being a member at Berkeley finance club. People have gotten in with demonstrated interest in a typical business careers, but the typically wrote about it and showcase a particularly unique aspect of that career, for example, wanted to go into environmental consulting or wanting to do investment banking for new tech companies to help grow them versus simply to make money. All this is to say I wouldn’t join a club in particular to apply to the program because that is not a guaranteed thing, but I would join a finance club if you feel like that club‘s actual knowledge And network could improve your life, or that the social connections will be a fun time. I would think of the club choice as an independent decision from the application.

In terms of clubs, Berkeley finance club is the most well known and connected. They do things like pitching a stock, intro to basic financial statements, how to do well in banking interviews, etc. However, in my experience, they have a history of hazing and heavy drinking, so to me if you believe you can gain a lot of that knowledge on your own via your own research then I wouldn’t think it’s worth it, but it is a good one stop shop for all the information you would need. I believe there’s a similar accounting society and a consulting club on campus, but I don’t have much knowledge there.

Instead, I would actually target on doing an internship either while at school or in the summer. If you can land a pretty interesting professional experience that will do much better on your application than a club would, as it shows genuine integration into the workforce."
,a bunch of ppl in the best consulting/business & tech clubs at berkeley are forming a new club called Business & Software at Berkeley. might be worth checking out if you want to gain some professional/project experience and grow ur network
,"Depends on which club you are applying… Honestly, this is super common and barely registers as a “challenge” in most club apps. People put down depression, anxiety, panic attacks, eating disorders, suicidal ideation, multiple suicide attempts, near fatal overdoses, psychotic breaks, months in psych wards… we have seen all of it. You are not going to shock anyone and nobody on the review side is clutching pearls over mental health anymore. 

The only thing that matters is if you actually make it interesting. If it is just “I struggled, then I got better” it will get skimmed and forgotten. If you want it to stand out, it has to have concrete actions, ugly details, and clear growth, not just vibes. Otherwise it is just another story in the giant stack of mental health essays they have already read."

,"I think some clubs just don’t want to manage a lot of people. You have 300-500 people applying to sone consulting clubs and it logistically does not make sense for that club to take in everyone and give a great experience for all. Some of it definitely does have to do with pretentious, but I think that’s the realistic side of it."
,Part of it is definitely a little bit of pretentiousness but also it helps some clubs make sure they are filled with active participants
,"You have a bunch of 18 year olds who were top 10% of their class in high school, told they were god’s gift to this earth who now are all lumped into together with other top 10%’ers and now are no longer special. 

As such, They need a way to distinguish themselves, and going to Berkeley is not enough — everyone here goes to Berkeley. So you have feigned exclusivity, which makes them feel good about themselves — I am special like I once was!

Another reason is that consulting club and business culture has trickled down into other clubs and it’s terrible. While business jobs don’t necessarily have any required technical skills — all they require is social prestige, there is no reason CS clubs or engineering clubs need to operate this way. Engineers are paid for their technical skills, not how well they can blend into a feigned exclusive environment, “interviewed” by other upper middle class Asian kids 2 years older than them from Bay Area high schools wearing their dusted off prom suits. 

Lastly, let me reassure you that it does NOT have to be this way. A lot of folks here say it’s “supply and demand” or what have you. Fair enough, but as you mentioned, do you really think UCSD doesn’t have this same problem of too many students? Or any other public school? This is exclusively a top college issue where clubs HAVE to be exclusive, because otherwise the kids would feel bad. 

ASUC could come out tomorrow and declare that all clubs must be open invite or else they lose all funding and are banned from campus. But they don’t. It has been done on campus before: The law school has effectively done this. So if you’re against this dumb club culture, you should vote for and lobby the ASUC to take action to increase equitable access for all those who want to join these clubs."
,"Many are pretty inclusive IMO. Calapalooza starts at 2pm today, take a look around to see what I mean 😊"
,"If they were to accept all the applicants, it would be too big to manage. I think it also helps as a motivating factor so the people inside participate more. (disclaimer: I never did these clubs)"
,Just don’t go for a consulting club.
,"Have you seen sproul these past few days? All of those people are trying to get into clubs. When your club becomes cool and popular, you have to become selective."
,"I was sad about not getting into any consulting clubs for a bit last year, and then I landed a consulting internship and realized those clubs are pretty useless. Just attend resume workshops, work on your social skills/confidence, and attend job fairs and you'll be fine."
,"As someone who has been in one of the 3-5% acceptance rate clubs - it's really complicated but long story short there's not a good reason. In the end the selectiveness results in p bad toxicity, misogyny, etc. 

The justification my old club used was that they didn't think the training program scaled well, or that with larger groups of people there was lower 'retention' and that people wouldn't bond as much. They would specifically go for freshman with no committed social groups so they could make the club into their social group - making it difficult for them to leave. I wish I was joking, but I had been told more than once that I wasn't an 'ideal' recruit since I was a sophomore at the time. They would openly joke about it being a cult, but get offended if you called it one. 

It's also about prestige. This club is the only one I've been in that ranks people's applications based on 'intelligence' (which is a weird concept at best when only seeing their resume) and is so easily dismissive towards anyone and everyone. These people like being the 'best of the best' and don't want to share air with anyone who they consider less than. We had to have a club-wide talk about not talking down to people for their grades. People thought it was hilarious and made fun of the person who brought it up to begin with. Obviously not everyone's like that, some people are really wonderful - but most of the wonderful people are also very blind to the problems and won't notice them until they are pointed out. 

As for the argument about the training program scaling, I buy it to an extent. The training program is pretty bad as is and I genuinely believe that it would fall apart if it were any larger - but I think that speaks more to the incompetent pride of many of the members. The current state of the training program is all down to the people who created the program thinking that the new members shouldn't need high quality education because they should be 'smart enough to get it without that'. Yet they're shocked when they can't get a TA position. Ok. 

Almost all of the people in those clubs are really, really smart. And some of them are great people. But most aren't great people, and the space is disgustingly toxic. I can only speak to the tech space but wouldn't be surprised if business clubs operated similarly. I don't want to get too specific here about some worse experiences I had in case it gets tied back to me, but I am happy to tell you more about my experiences via DMs if you are curious."
,I was real confused and thought we were talking about clubbing for a second there.
,"Join interest clubs (boxing,birding,weightlifting,coffee,outdoors,mediation, Disney,religion,ect.) tend to not have selection unless it’s fashion or dance unfortunately!! Also MOST ethnic/culture clubs don’t have selection it depends !"
,You should create a new club so that there are more opportunities!
,Just lie and put it on your resume
,"Completely ego. I really wanted to do Model UN when I was a student, and I think they kept rejecting because of my technical major and lack of prev debate experience. Still salty

There’s no reasonable logic to be selective in a lot of cases, who’s monitoring the clubs to make sure they’re not just taking in their friends or excluding people randomly. Everyone is paying the same tuition more or less, why wouldn’t the tuition cover being in multiple clubs 

One thing is the school could provide more staff involvement to support club logistics like this"

,"i have information about it, but just do it.   if your interested, that is the only way to find out."
,im also a beginner and i suspect that there will be many beginners
,"You can definitely do it and I think it's very much worth trying! I think it's always a good sign if you see that the club has a lot of members who joined as a junior (as a freshman admit or transfer), which you can see during their recruitment events.

There are sooo many consulting clubs that have all different niches and purposes, so you should have a lot of options!

If anything, something I noticed is that people who join clubs as a freshman usually burn out or ""retire"" by the time they hit their junior year (or join another club), so I would almost argue juniors are more likely to be more ""productive"" members of a consulting club.

,"I’m not gonna lie
I’ve had two moments where I’ve found some corner on campus and just cried my eyes out 

And both times have been discovered by someone, who then says something along the lines of “you need Jesus” and then invites me to their fellowship 

The first time it happened they seemed offended that I wanted to be alone and told me all my problems were because I was rejecting God 

The second was a girl from Gracepoint and every time she would spot me on campus from that point forward, she would approach me and keep insisting I come. 

It got to the point where she would walk across the street even if we were going different directions, and I’d run into her multiple time a week, even after I asked her nicely to stop. I still see her around campus sometimes and actively avoid her at this point over a year later. 

TLDR, just don’t engage with anyone trying to get you to join their fellowship, even if it seems like they have good intentions, and DEFINITELY don’t talk to anyone from Gracepoint. 😐"
,"Avoid Unification church (aka Moonies), unless you are desperate for excessive brain washing.

,"All religious groups are cults \s

But really when I was a freshman I would take advantage of free food but I was constantly bothered by them afterwards so it wasn’t really worth it"
,"going against the grain here. most clubs seeking new members table, and many of them (religious or not) are very in your face about it. i get approached a lot by the TEDxBerkeley group and they’re very aggressive. but i bet no one thinks they’re a cult based off that alone. 

“cult” has been used so loosely. you should really look up what distinguishes a cult from other belief-centered groups."
,"Hey op:
You got a lot of advice. Some of it even substantive. 

I think you asked a good question that hits something lots of us Christians at different times are weary of. I can imagine for non-Christians it’s at least as wearisome. Not  100% sure which you are, no offense, but sounds like you are a follower of Jesus Christ.

You mentioned you’re easily swayed. Something like that resonates with me-I’m not easily swayed but I tend to give people the time of day. I mean, sometimes I have a clear peace to avoid or shutdown people/places, but often times I hear/feel it out and pray.

I’ve engaged with and prayed with a lot of brothers and sisters in Christ at Cal. If their theology is off and you know it, it’s still sometimes nice to have that conversation. If you don’t know it, often times those conversations have encouraged me to seek Truth more, in the Word, in further study, in fellowship.

Don’t be afraid. Thats a commandment we have from one of the more popular Bible verses, the ones that folks love to put on our coffee mugs and t shirts.

God bless you in Jesus name 🫶"

,"Consulting clubs that actually do something real are worth looking into. Thing is, most of them don't."
,"Being on the work side for a few years I can tell the difference between someone who's been in a consulting club and someone who hasn't. (FYI I don't work for a consulting, accounting, finance, law firm.) They know how to present. I can slam them in a meeting and they can go with a deck they've seen for the first time 10 minutes ago. For noobs, in case you don't know being able to present is 75% of professionalism. Speaking of decks, they know what one is, can make one, tear it down and re-build it better. I can leave them with the client for a moment and not worry about losing the account or heaven forbid, them asking the client for a job. Myself, I've never been in a consulting club (wish I had been and given myself a boost up), I just see the results. And sometimes hire them."
,"I was at a community college and i had a prehealth club I led for 2 years, id say it was really helpful and I was able to help a decent amount of students. Ngl I feel like that helped me a lot in my admissions.

However a lot of the clubs seem pretty toxic somewhat and kind of useless, i saw some of them have extremely low acceptance rates and that you even have to submit transcripts and interview which makes zero sense lol 

Id prob just join what truly appeals to you, I found a couple clubs on campus who were genuinely there to help students"
,"If the club you want to join builds projects, that's a benefit because you'll be collaborating with other people to build something. For that project, if you work with a client and have weekly meetings, that's also a benefit as well, because it gives you the real world experience. I was in a club my last year at Berkeley, and it was worth my time 100%."

Then if those friends manage to get hired by a company you have an ""in.""

So to build connections in case you get in a situation where you can't find a job and gotta be like, ""Hey man, put in a good word for me at your job. I wanna apply there."""
,"It's mostly just networking and interview prep. It's not at all necessary to get into consulting, I landed a consulting internship paying me $46/hr with no prior experience besides retail. They may help, but not that much."
,"They give advice, so basically imagine that you want to wear a hermes bag and you approach the Gucci Gang Squad consulting club for some advice. They're gonna be like ""No sweetie, I don't think so"".

,"Consulting clubs are useful as far as providing resources for case prep and perhaps some opportunities to network with firms. Beyond that, the value of the “projects” they work is negligible to the companies and perhaps a better version of interview prep for the club members.

,I applied to 0 clubs at Berkeley and did just fine. Did FAANG internships and got multiple full time offers to choose from. No you do not have to suck up to clubs to be successful.
,Your post needs more upvotes!
,"I was in ExComm for a fairly large club, but not one that required interviews - eventually becoming President in my senior year. 

As you mentioned, being in a club, especially in a leadership position, gave me a lot of tools that have laid a good foundation for my work life (I work in marketing so nothing I actually studied in Polk Sci gave me a material boost to my career) - being able to budget, convince people to work together as a team, direct groups, stand up in front of a room and deliver information and get people excited to work on club projects, all those skills have been super valuable.


But on my resume? It’s half a sentence. Have I ever talked about it in an interview? No. Has it ever gotten me a margin of help in securing a job? Not directly."
,Stating the obvious but I guess it doesn't hurt to say it.
,"Agree with OP, no one cares about resume filler items like clubs. Looking for personality, problem solving ability and intellectual curiosity in the interview process. General industry assumption re new grad hires is that they have relevant foundational knowledge, but really not much useful detail about actual business or tech functions"
,"Well said. I’m alumni as well and it’s beneficial to read this post. There’s a lot left down the road, and getting into any club is not going to make or break you. Focus on what skills you can acquire and how you can use them to solve any problems for the company you wish to work for or build."
,Yeah this extreme focus on clubs just baffles me. I don't give a rat's ass as a hiring manager which clubs you belonged to. That was high school stuff you did to get into college. You want to boost your hiring chances upon graduation? Forget about clubs and get a part-time job in your field. Over 90% of the people who will read your resume don't care at all about school. They want solid evidence you can actually use your knowledge for money.
,"Amen. 

Another point would be for those who are the proud VP of Director of Cap Picture AI club, please keep in mind natural attritions always happen for any organization, so putting this meritocratic process that's more selective than most job interviews isn't likely doing much favor for the club itself in the long run."

There’s no formula for this. Many roads can lead to the same destination."
,"What matters are the friends you make, not the name of the club"
,Spend your time you would've invested in applying for clubs and apply for jobs/internships/research. Definitely not easy either but you'll hopefully get something more out of it.
,My friends at Stanford go through the same thing with consulting clubs lol
,"> “nepotism”

Remove the quotation marks from that. That’s exactly the type of shit that goes on with those *certain* clubs. Make your own club or join a club where they’re not picky about who joins, you’ll find a lot more value than trying to get in with a group who’d likely not consider you"
,"yeah berkeley club culture is highkey toxic. if i could talk to myself the first day of university, i would tell myself:

1. a lot of these clubs are more like mini-frats that do big projects. they're as much of a curated social circle as they are a resume padder, so unfortunately that means it really is all one big popularity contest. i've heard of people getting rejected because they gave someone a weird glance at a coffee chat.
2. they aren't the only way to get stuff on your resume! i guess it depends on ur major but there's lots of great project based clubs that are open to anyone willing to help. and ofc there's research
3. don't underrate social clubs either. having a space to hang out with like-minded people with no pressure sprouts a surprising amount of opportunities. and they're also often fully open to the public
4. hang in there, this school is kinda batshit insane im not even gonna lie"
,"Fr bro. Ngl I feel like we as students should ban together and create the clubs we want without the whole application process. Obviously this would take a couple semester to plan out resource wise, but I think it would be better to give people opportunities and thus creating some sort of cycle to give back to the club and hopefully manage to stay in profit (depending on the niche of your club). That way the new clubs are able to depend on its members to keep its existence alive"
,"It is tempting to get into a nice-looking professional or consulting club, whether for career or for socializing, or a little bit of both. It may be different for you, depending on how you operate or what your field of study is, but the main thing I got out of any club was making friends, and you can really do that with any club. 

For context, I was an applied math major in a filmmaking club. What I got out of the club was some filmmaking skills (for fun), good friends (can find anywhere!), and one board position (which probably isn't going on my resume in 4 years). Maybe I would think differently if I joined some data science club, but I also got into competitive research internships without being in any fancy club. The strongest plus of a club is networking, but I heard about some tech workers blocking berkeley clubs that were trying to network or consult lol.

 I would say if you want to join a club with an application, try going for a newer and less competitive one. I actually think helping a newer club could be better professionally, as you may have more leverage to lead and develop the club into something good. That kind of initiative and leadership is always good for your resume!"
,"Do not sleep on the other resources. While in the big picture it did not matter for me, I regret not going to more of the “everyone gets in” extracurriculars. I thought I HAD to get into the exclusive clubs or nothing."
,">This is the only school where people fr have to jump through hoops to get into clubs

No it's not, but it's definitely the worst because of the combination of competition/size.

Sure it's nepo but if they like you by chance you'll still be ""nepo-d"" anyways"
,It’s always the same faces …
,"I don't understand it. For a school that's inclusive, it's a very exclusive thing they allow."
,"yep and they simply judge on limited survey responses. I have someone who is very experienced (3 years of coding experience) getting denied and there are less skilled people getting into the clubs for their projects. Fucking ironic too.

And Codeology and ML@B don’t look much at your qualifications at all. They only read the quality of your survey responses and make a judgement. Just a very narrow method to get people in while claiming that “oh you don’t need experience to apply” yet their new member programs (for no exp) is very limited in people - for the case of ML@B which only has 1X people out of so many. Defeats the purpose of the clubs and people can’t explore their interests. The fucking cringey thing is these are just students who might not even know how to recruit properly. 💀
(Also the new member program of ML@B has a compulsory project and it’s not a decal, just not good investment if you are looking for units and you can just learn online)

An insider thing (I have a roommate doing club recruiting) is that those clubs get an excel list of your survey responses and grade them from A to F and pick the ones with best responses for the clubs. This happens for many, especially if they are resume blind or do not even consider your qualifications while asking for your resume in your application 

Worst still clubs like Codeology can send out interviews invites only to withdraw in an hour later with a sugarcoated white lie, just plain rude. When you haven’t done ANYTHING. That happened this semester with the president of Codeology from my friend. 😐

Simply they can deny a PhD student who isn’t very good at socializing or crafting survey responses. Your chances of getting in are from really knowing an internal member or to improving your survey responses or to relating the club to yourself.
(Qualifications may matter but survey responses can matter much more that survey response >>>>> qualification and it is too much weighting on survey responses) 

At least open a taster course instead if you keep claiming that “we have too many applications to accept” while keeping the system, lmao. Or have online zoom support for your new member training so you can expand seats, bruh 🤷‍♂️

Clubs are just weird af yet good at selling themselves. But not all clubs have good projects (e.g. some consulting clubs have very loose projects while being selective). 

Better enroll in URAP or find a real internship or something equivalent as a good club project or improve your survey responses to that club or find a professor to get you into research. That’s better than enrolling in a student club you were rejected from. Remember that what is offered in a club has QUALITY too. It is only that the club being very good at selling themselves, not necessarily reflecting the quality of the club (tho some clubs projects are good really)"

This is the essence of why I did not apply to any clubs this year, I hate hypocrites!"
,"Maybe not a common thing, but marksmanship is something I did in highschool that I wish Berkeley had. Like with air rifles and competitions."
,"Every year people think exactly the way that you do — screw the system, it’s so selective and toxic, let’s make new clubs! And then most of the clubs  die but some get popular. Then the popular ones need to weed out some and then start applications, then interviews, then the “open” club becomes the very thing they swore not to become, one just like every other club on campus. 

The real solution is to force ASUC to turn back the clock 12 years and change it to like when you were here. Ban all clubs that require applications from being affiliated with the school. 

There is really no other way forward because it’s like when you arrive at Berkeley, you’re not truly admitted to Berkeley. You have to apply for “Berkeley” all over again in that you need to apply for the Berkeley experience: clubs, friends, retreats to Tahoe and good career opportunities. How you do on freshman year club applications determine the trajectory of your entire undergraduate experience, and more freshmen should be pissed about the state of the club system here."

,"I’m in tbg and you actually did a great job in describing the clubs. We actually do pretty well with job placements, but there are less people interested in ib roles than consulting. I also haven’t had to pay dues yet but as we’re pro-Bono we don’t have Amazon giving us a bunch of $ for projects but since our mission is to help non-profits that don’t have the funding to hire McKinsey not being as wealthy as the other clubs is not really a priority."

Best for Social Impact: The Berkeley Group

Best for Coding: CodeBase

Best for Product Management: Product Space

Best for Marketing: magical|

Best for Art: Berkeley Innovation"

,"asian, attractive check and familiarity if you went to their events"
,"Thinking these club apps are based on meritocracy is funny lol. It's like 90% about friendships and 10% actual work. There are some clubs that do actual stuff like the robotics ones, but most are just partying."
,Does anyone know if they want a professional headshot or a casual pic for these
,"It’s so it’s easier to recognize and remember people when they are deliberating. When you have a lot of people applying and are interviewing, names blur together. But I get your point."
,"thank you so much for this!!! as a transfer student, i appreciate this a lot :’)"
,That’s the realistic practice of today’s tech hiring. Put that time finding a real job and leetcoding lol
,None of the tech clubs here care about technical ability it’s all social fit—lowkey i think there may be a gap in the market for people who have significant experience because everything is catered towards beginners.
,"All interviews for tech clubs are behavioral. They care way more that you are someone they want to hang out with than technical experience. That said, it's also all pretty random so don't feel like getting rejected is any sort of judgment on you personally."
,"With some exceptions, a lot of the decisions are made on how ""likeable"" a candidate is. There are some things you can do to bolster your chances - i.e. have some experience beforehand, know someone in leadership, engage in all aspects of recruiting - but at the end of the day, it unfortunately comes down to did you vibe with the interviewer better or did the other person. And there's little to nothing you can do to control this. Source: I'm in leadership in one of the tech clubs, and while I'm not involved with recruiting out of choice, I've seen these decisions being made."
,"It sucks, but the only way forward is to make you own club. It’s always hard to get into established things, e.g., clubs, companies, organisations, etc because all the risk is hidden from you — you just show up and apply and do projects other people have gotten for you. 

Get some buddies together and start your own club, source some projects and by next fall, you could be the one flyering on sproul and rejecting people like yourself."
,"I'm just not going to join one (a tech club). Ugh I know... it's just.... I'm not going to join one, that's all. Hahahaha"
,">Why tf are the tech clubs at Berkeley so selective?

High student population + high variance in this student population + ""vibe"""
,"May I ask why joining these clubs would be worth any of your time? No don’t apply again.

Lmao idk who’s downvoting but I’ll be real. No amount of experience you have really matters if you don’t fit socially and culturally. You’re a third year with work experience and research, spend your time applying for those opportunities instead. I ask that question initially because I don’t see much that these clubs provide that you can’t find yourself elsewhere. Assuming you’re talking about tech/consulting clubs. Interested in the social aspect? There are many other clubs that provide that without an application. Want to network? Go to public networking events. You’re not missing out on anything by being in one of these clubs."
,No offense but fuck the clubs. This is my opinion but unless a club is going to do something for you they're not worth it.
,"No, start looking for a full time job"
,"Are there any sports you enjoy and play fairly well? Most of Cal's teams need practice players (guys play against the women's team for instance), or volunteers to help with office/field/court chores. This could expand your social life and add more to your resume."
,"Absolutely, you should keep applying to clubs!
Here’s why:
 * Demonstrates Interest: Applying shows initiative and genuine interest in extracurriculars beyond just academics and work experience.
 * Leadership & Teamwork: Even if you haven’t secured a position yet, the act of applying shows you’re willing to step up and be part of a team.
 * Chance of Acceptance: It’s still early in your junior year. Many clubs have rolling admissions or accept new members throughout the year. Your impressive resume could make you a desirable candidate.
Key Points:
 * Focus on clubs aligned with your interests or future goals.
 * Consider smaller, lesser-known clubs where competition might be lower.
 * Tailor your applications, highlighting how your skills and experiences would benefit the club.
 * Don’t be discouraged by past rejections. Persistence pays off!
It’s definitely NOT a waste of time! Keep applying, and best of luck!"

,Pretty sure it’s mostly behavioral q or case question if consulting but their interview is all about “vibe checks” lol. It’s more about how much they like you/ if you have friends the club than having a perfect response. 
,"I wouldnt expect them to be publicly available. But if you wanted to cheat, you can find current members and ask them what they were asked. But you should be your authentic self."
,"No club is going to have past interview questions publicly available.  Just be yourself and if you don't know something own up to it positively.  No matter what, don't make up a whole new identity and bs answer just to get into a club."

data/tech consulting:
- any club with data in their name (data good, data story, idk the rest but chances are they all do the same thing
- valley consulting (one of the more “upper tier” clubs, can be hard to get into
- upsync consulting

product/design:
- berkeley innod 
- productspace 
- any club with innovation/design in their name

nonprofit/social impact:
- grc (global research & consulting)
- 180 degrees consulting
- the berkeley group (TBG)

if you’re also interested in finance: 
- microfinance at berkeley (they consult for small companies i believe)

healthcare-specific:
- hcg (healthcare consulting group)
- phoenix

entertainment/media: 
- BCEC

general consulting:
- for these, honestly they all do the same thing. i would say personally just go to infosessions for anyone that you’re interested in, talk to the people and just get a gauge on vibe so you can narrow down your options
- you can do like a mass apply (10+ clubs) but lowkey it’s rlly not that worth it, its a waste of your time, and these clubs talk to each other anyways so they all know what you’re applying to
- focus on making yourself stand out in coffee chats, interviews, and everything else as that’s really the code in my opinion to getting into these clubs
- if you’re rejected, it’s not that big of a deal either! at the end of the day they’re also just students lol and they honestly have no say in how your future trajectory is going to follow anyways so don’t take anything too personally"

To answer your question though, you probably won’t have a shot of getting in. There aren’t that many that get in as juniors let alone senior transfers. They may not explicitly be biased intentionally but there’s just little benefit to both parties here"

,"I think more clubs should take note of the way that the Formula clubs at Berkeley do their recruitment - at least for more technical clubs. Essentially, they spend a couple of weeks of recruitment for a multi-part recruitment project, requiring a final deliverable. The project is usually a research task and a design challenge - usually a part on the car relevant to each respective team. Yes, this seems like a lot of work both for club members and recruits, but I think it’s worth it. Here’s why:

For recruits:
1. It allows recruits to connect with the members of the club, and specifically the team they are opting to join. This is through mandatory office hour where recruits work directly with members on aspects of the project.
2. It serves as an initial training/onboarding for recruits to gain exposure to technical elements of the club, very similar to the work they would be doing once they join.
3. Even if recruits are not selected, it is a learning experience for gaining exposure to technical elements just through their participation.

For the club:
1. It serves as a gauge for recruits’ commitment as this may become an issue down the line when commitment is necessary.
2. If recruits can dedicate a couple hours over a couple of weeks, to the club recruitment, it shows their interest and willingness to work/learn.
3. It serves as a test for previous technical knowledge of the recruits to see how well-versed they are in the technical elements.
4. Working with recruits during office hours serves as a behavioral interview on its own as it is very informal and conversational.

Basically, for a recruit, you know what you’re getting into when you join and, for clubs, you know you are getting a committed and dedicated recruit. Only sacrifice is a couple of weeks at the beginning of the semester when everyone is settling in already."

,"Hey everyone, our Decal still has not been posted to the Decal website, but enrollment is open. [Fill out this form to enroll](https://forms.gle/oCSh7V8fRgyBo9k59).

**DECAL: Bioinspired Design in Action**

**Logistics**  
Course Location: Jacobs Hall Room 10 (basement)  
Course Time: Mondays 5-7 pm  
OH: TBD  
Course Credit: 2 Units

**Course Description:**   
How can we utilize biological systems to create more innovative designs? In this course, we will dive into the process of using biological research to inform design with a major focus on hands-on design and construction. We will focus heavily on project deliverables, with lecture-based classes intended to support projects through the development of skills like 3D printing and laser cutting. The early projects help students to develop proficiency in these skills. The final project will be interdisciplinary in nature but must be biologically inspired, with some hands-on components.

Are you thinking:  
“But wait! I don’t have any experience and this seems advanced!”?

Don’t worry! This class is for you. We will cover how to make things and approach biology in a design-oriented way. We will equip you with everything you need to know to succeed in this course in a low-pressure and supportive environment.  
**All majors and levels of knowledge are welcome.**"

,"Pew pew!  
The sound of blaster fire fills the air as you're running away from those pesky stormtroopers. Grabbing your lightsaber, it ignites with a hum, the blade illuminating the dark hall you stand in. More stormtroopers file in, their white and black armor almost a certain sign of doom...  
A loud explosion sounds through the air, rubble falling from the sky. Running to take cover, you discover a group descending from the ceiling... Was that the legendary Rebel Alliance of California?   
Dressed in gold and blue, they're your only hope. Blaster fire fills the hall, and a big furry brown creature helps you escape from those pesky stormtroopers sent by the notorious Galactic Empire of Stanford.  
Finally, you run into a small ship and the furry creature turns around. Its Oski!  
""Will you join the Rebel Alliance of California?"" he asks.

,I can tell you that you will not get into either of these off cycle but you should just apply in the fall.  Traders at Berkeley is probably the premier one to join although CIB is decent. You probably need to rework your resume though because joining one of these clubs isn’t a prerequisite in any way.
,"Start building your network. Go to LinkedIn and cold email for coffee chat. Do your research. No club is going to let you in randomly. Start preparing for you interview, both technical and behavioral. Review your resume and get ready for the next internship cycle. You have all the time you need this summer.

,"chill, clubs aren’t that important. You freshmen and sophomores are too obsessed with it"
,"Option 4: Look for volunteer opportunities around the community where you can use some of your professional skills (programming, marketing, whatever) to help a non-profit organization in need. It's a win-win - you helped someone out and you also get to put the experience on your resume AND also establish professional contacts who can serve as a reference later.  [Idealist.org](https://Idealist.org) is a good place to look for volunteer opportunities in the community.  You can do a search for specific volunteer jobs, or simply browse nearby organizations that fit your interests and email them to see if they need any help.  (Note - volunteer opportunities are different from unpaid internships. They only require a few hours of commitment per week and allow you time to focus on your studies or on any paid employment you have.)

Great suggestions, OP. I see these posts and truly feel for y'all. Cal is competitive enough without having to worry about interview processes or resume building for student-run extracurriculars. For redditors reading this, I know that club membership feels important, especially since you were conditioned to be ""well rounded"" when applying for college. But here's the thing (as someone who has been successful landing post BA jobs and getting into selective PhD programs): grad programs and post-college jobs don't give a shit if other students selected you for  the consulting club in college. They'd rather see that you have applied your professional skills in practical ways. Practical work experience in any form (yes, even your part time job doing data entry or retail) means just as much, if not MORE than membership in some random student organization.  Recruiters and interviewers asked me a lot more questions about my volunteer work and weird work-study jobs than college extracurriculars."
,"Context: I am a junior and have been involved in teaching, research, and one (non-consulting but we do cool projects) club my time here at Cal. I have never really been interested in the 'consulting' clubs that advertise really hard.

However, seeing all the complaints I decided to apply for a couple this year (specifically consulting teams') to see what it is about. I receive interviews for them (probably given my prior experience since I am a junior). And God damn it is stupid. Sophomores interviewed me like I was applying for full time at a company. Like I kid you not the same exact type of leadership questions + technical questions + a coding challenge. I don't believe most random freshman that saw the tables and applied with little experience would even be able to answer the technical questions. Why the hell would you go through this process for an organization that isn't paying you or worth that much??? And yes, I have interned previously at a top, high-paying company for SWE and am again this summer. It's not even about being unfair or selective, it's just dumb. If you could really take on these interviews you have no problem entering industry.

Also, don't apply for 'social reasons' or 'making friends' either; doing a whole ass job interview process for some friends is just sad. At that point just go join Greek life (at least they're just looking to have fun and not operating on some facade of 'real work') or search harder and talk to people in better, more niche clubs. Not all clubs are like this (like I said I am in one and have had a positive experience), but the culture really is bad here at Cal."
,I hear there’s a fight club that’s accepting new members. You could always take out your frustrations there.
,There could be a badger-themed club for people who got rejected from other clubs.
,"UCLA student here. Got rejected from a pre-law organization/frat so I took Option 3. The frat left their email list from rush public so I copied all of the emails, sent out a GroupMe link, and started UCLA’s first social pre-law club. Sure, I got a little hate from the frat. But my club has the biggest and most active
pre law GroupMe ;) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND OPTION 3."
,"Option 3 plz. Take it from someone who graduated in 2010, no recruiter cares if you were in one of these clubs. Not one bit. Do something interesting that makes you a human being. Join a club sport. Go build houses somewhere for a summer. Work on a campaign for someone who you believe in but has no shot of winning. Don't be a robot.

If you really, really want to go into consulting (and as someone who tried it on for 3 months after grad school, really, do anything else), just about everyone I knew who ended up in consulting was not in one of these clubs."

Go online and really internalize all the acronyms for how to analyze companies. Practice obviously. Tbh this advice if ur gonna try hard the application. These things rlly don’t matter especially if you’re trying to do SWE. I’d also say put some business related experience on ur resume too
,"Lets see, how do you look? Physiognomy will determine it"
,"idk if this applies to all consulting clubs, but a lot of the people ik in some clubs (Voyager + Diversatech off the top of my head) have a SWE background/are actively recruiting SWE + their resumes reflect that-- i don't think its necessarily having done consulting/business/PM in the past, more just impactful experiences + the usual teamwork/leadership/etc."
,"Follow the 2 rules: 

1. Be attractive 
2. Don’t be unattractive

You think this is a joke, but I was roommates with leadership in one of these consulting clubs, and they basically said that it came down to looks (assuming that the person was somewhat eloquent and not a complete idiot)."

We have no application--each subteam has its own intro project that you will have time and guidance to complete during your first semester of membership.

We also design, test, and manufacture our own payloads and avionics systems. Our payloads last year include an atmospheric muon detector, a bacteria-powered biochemical battery, an active stabilization system, and more. We're also in the process of building and testing a liquid engine. If you want to learn how to handle 
explosives, build a rocket engine from the ground up, bond with the coolest space nerds on the block, or anything in between, come check us out ;)

(Also, many people on STAR would tell you they've gotten hired because of their STAR experience. We have recruitment events with various space companies, and regularly have members intern at places like NASA, SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Maxar, etc) 

Our website is [stars.berkeley.edu](http://stars.berkeley.edu), and you can email us at ucberkeleystar@gmail.com."

," **Food Science and Technology**

1. We are a group of students who are curious about food science, sustainable food systems, cooking, and other related topics. Usually, club activities include tech talks, factory tours, hackathons, workshops, and networking. This semester, all of our events will be held on Zoom. We are planning to bring in guest speakers from industry and do some cool food demos virtually.

,"Old Blue here. Rhetoric 10. The class was prescient when I took it back in the late 90s, and now I can't imagine trying to make sense of the world around me without the skills I learned in that class. Our professor argued that throughout all of history, gaining access to information was the problem to be solved. Then he told us that, for the first time in history, the problem facing our generation would be determining what was *good* information. And then he taught us how to look at any piece of information and start asking: Who wrote this? What is their motivation? And I being manipulated? If so, how? Over the last five or six years, I've wished all of us were required to take that class."
