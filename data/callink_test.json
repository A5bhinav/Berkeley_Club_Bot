    "name": "*New Callink Feature: Blue Heart Initiative 💙",
    "short_description": "Joining Student Organizations using the Blue Heart Initiative The Blue Heart Initiative is a feature on CalLink identifying registered student organizations that are classified as ‘open membership.’ These organizations may require a form to record demonstrated interest, but there is no formal application to be accepted into the organization. A blue heart [💙] placed next to the organization’s name on CalLink indicates they meet this requirement and opted-in to this feature. Look for this blue heart as you explore organizations to join. The Blue Heart Initiative is brought to you by the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) and Organization Advising and Student Involvement Services (OASIS). Frequently Asked Questions: 1) Is my RSO eligible to participate? Any Registered Student Organization (RSO) that indicates they 'accept all' interested members during the yearly registration process are eligible. These organizations may require a form to record demonstrated interest, but there should be no formal application to be accepted into the organization. 2) How can my Registered Student Organization (RSO) sign-up and get a blue heart added to our name? Eligible RSOs will have the opportunity to opt-in to this initiative during the yearly RSO registration process. 3) When will the Blue Heart be added to our RSO's Name on CalLink? Blue Hearts will be added to RSO's Names on CalLink on a rolling basis as registration forms are processed. 4) Does it matter if my RSO is a Graduate RSO? No, Graduate and Undergraduate RSOs are eligible to participate in this program. 5) Does my RSO have to participate in this initiative if we are eligible? No, you are not required to participate in this initiative. Your RSO must consent to participating via the registration process. 6) How does my RSO opt-out if we are no longer open membership? Please have an RSO representative (ideally the same person who opted into the BHI) complete the Blue Heart Initiative Opt-Out Form. 7) What's the difference between an 'Application' and an 'Interest Form'? An RSO may use an 'Interest Form' to record contact and other information for internal purposes, but they will not use this information to evaluate whether you can be a member of their RSO or not. An 'Application' is a tool used to screen potential members for interviews and, ultimately, membership.",

    "short_description": "The furry fandom is a subculture interested in anthropomorphic animals. Its origins date back to at least the 1980s in science fiction and comic conventions. Due to the diversity within the fandom, as well as fictional portrayals of the fandom based heavily on stereotypes, a certain amount of stigma and controversy is unfortunately associated with the fandom. The Anthropomorphic Animal Appreciation Association hopes to serve and portray the furry population on campus positively, as well as foster community collaboration between furries at Berkeley with other interest-based or academic groups.Follow Us :3 Bluesky | Twitter | Instagram | TikTok | Mailing List",
