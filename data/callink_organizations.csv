*New Callink Feature: Blue Heart Initiative 💙,"Joining Student Organizations using the Blue Heart Initiative The Blue Heart Initiative is a feature on CalLink identifying registered student organizations that are classified as ‘open membership.’ These organizations may require a form to record demonstrated interest, but there is no formal application to be accepted into the organization. A blue heart [💙] placed next to the organization’s name on CalLink indicates they meet this requirement and opted-in to this feature. Look for this blue heart as you explore organizations to join. The Blue Heart Initiative is brought to you by the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) and Organization Advising and Student Involvement Services (OASIS). Frequently Asked Questions: 1) Is my RSO eligible to participate? Any Registered Student Organization (RSO) that indicates they 'accept all' interested members during the yearly registration process are eligible. These organizations may require a form to record demonstrated interest, but there should be no formal application to be accepted into the organization. 2) How can my Registered Student Organization (RSO) sign-up and get a blue heart added to our name? Eligible RSOs will have the opportunity to opt-in to this initiative during the yearly RSO registration process. 3) When will the Blue Heart be added to our RSO's Name on CalLink? Blue Hearts will be added to RSO's Names on CalLink on a rolling basis as registration forms are processed. 4) Does it matter if my RSO is a Graduate RSO? No, Graduate and Undergraduate RSOs are eligible to participate in this program. 5) Does my RSO have to participate in this initiative if we are eligible? No, you are not required to participate in this initiative. Your RSO must consent to participating via the registration process. 6) How does my RSO opt-out if we are no longer open membership? Please have an RSO representative (ideally the same person who opted into the BHI) complete the Blue Heart Initiative Opt-Out Form. 7) What's the difference between an 'Application' and an 'Interest Form'? An RSO may use an 'Interest Form' to record contact and other information for internal purposes, but they will not use this information to evaluate whether you can be a member of their RSO or not. An 'Application' is a tool used to screen potential members for interviews and, ultimately, membership.",BHI,Active,,blueheartinitiative,https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/blueheartinitiative,,BHI is a new feature identifying student organizations that don’t require an application and are classified as ‘open membership.’ A blue heart [💙] next to the group means they meet this requirement and opted-in to the feature.

American Constitution Society at Berkeley 💙,"ACS About Us The American Constitution Society (ACS) believes that law should be a force to improve the lives of all people. ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy. Shaping Debate. The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country’s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates “intellectual capital” for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues. The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as “originalism” and “strict construction” that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law. Building Networks. One of the American Constitution Society’s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics. The engine that drives the organization’s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance. Making a Difference. The strength of ACS’s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken’s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that “Originalism isn’t a pillar of our constitutional history; it’s a talking point;” and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.",ACS,Active,,acs,https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/acs,"Graduate Student Organizations, Blue Heart Initiative Category","The American Constitution Society believes that law should be a force to improve the lives of all people.

Asian American and Pacific Islander Health Research Group,"AAPIHRG Video We are a group of San Francisco Bay Area health professionals and UC Berkeley undergraduates/alumni. On this campus—where 42% of students identified as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) in 2008—there was not a single academic course devoted to the study of health in AAPI communities. The AAPI Health Research Group (AAPIHRG) was formed in 2008 to fill this void. The purpose of this group is to share our journey and findings in AAPI community health with other students and community professionals who may wish to join us or contribute to the work. Although the aggregate data for our community paints a picture of a healthy population, we know that good health is not enjoyed by all. Our community is not homogeneous. The diversity of the many ethnic groups that make up the AAPI community presents challenges in obtaining accurate data. Students who come from these diverse backgrounds can be an important conduit in raising our awareness of health problems that exist in these communities. This can foster a deeper understanding of health in the broader AAPI community. Besides the 4-unit Spring course (ASAMST 190 - ""Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Community Health: Foundational Theories & Contemporary Issues""), we are inviting you to take part in our next steps as we develop as a student organization. We are open to all students interested in community health and specifically the AAPI community. We hope that through this organization, we foster in students a desire to serve the community as well as provide opportunities for leadership development and networking. We invite your participation in AAPIHRG as a student or as a health professional sharing the following vision and mission: VISION A healthy community can only exist within a healthy society.

We work with students in developing a thorough understanding of these programs with weekly lessons and hands-on tutorials. In addition, students complete relevant homework exercises which aim to give students the opportunity to practice tools, develop original designs, and channel their creativity. Lastly, we explore graphic design trends, principles, and applications. Graphic Design PrinciplesThis is a technical course in which students are taught extensive knowledge of Adobe programs (such as Illustrator and/or Photoshop). The class also covers conceptual and theoretical aspects of design such as color theory, branding, and user interface design. At the end of the course, students have a portfolio of work showcasing extensive knowledge on several design topics and an understanding of various elements of design. Photography PrinciplesThis DeCal is for students interested in learning photography. We start off with the basics (camera manipulations and shooting in RAW) and quickly move onto composition rules and tricks to get better, more thought out photos, and from there move onto how to be a professional photographer, photo ethics, and integrating art into photography. By the end, students will feel strong in their photographic abilities, be able to critique their own work, and see the world through an artistic eye, so they can further grow as a photographer. It is intended to be for beginners with little to no knowledge of how to use a dSLR or other camera with manual capabilities.

In reality, scientists, engineers, and researchers all work towards improving human lives and often need to tap into the vast resources of human creativity and empathy to do so. Art and creative writing allow us to consider these implications with an expressive freedom not afforded by lectures and laboratories. We believe that exploration of this intersection of sciences and humanities is just as crucial to scientific knowledge as concrete theories and research. We intend for Atrium to be a space that humanizes the sciences through the sharing of creative student reflections on these subjects.

Bay Area Scientists in Schools at Berkeley 💙,"Bay Area Scientists Inspiring Students (BASIS) volunteers foster scientific curiosity by connecting with kids and teachers through hands-on classroom experiences. BASIS is a science role model volunteer program that connects UC Berkeley graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and undergraduates with students in public elementary schools within the East Bay. There is a huge demand from teachers and students in our community to bring hands-on science and engineering lessons into the classroom! ""Tremendous! More, please!"" is the top comment from teachers who've had a BASIS visit. Program Goals The goals of BASIS are to (1) connect a diverse range of scientist volunteers to elementary school students and teachers, (2) inspire students with examples of real-world science careers and issues, (3) engage with students in hands-on, inquiry based learning experiences, and (4) create effective teaching links between scientists and public elementary schools in the East Bay. Program Mechanics UC Berkeley science and engineering students interested in becoming a BASIS volunteer must first sign up for a one-hour on-campus orientation (held on campus). Sign up for an orientation online (http://www.crscience.org/volunteers/signup). BASIS volunteers then form a teaching team (or join a pre-existing team) comprised of friends and colleagues in their field of study. Volunteers choose dates and times that they are available to visit classrooms and present a one-hour hands-on, inquiry-based lesson with their team. BASIS ensures that these lessons are age-appropriate and aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teams generally present in one classroom per month over the course of a school year (~10 lessons/year) though there is a high degree of flexibility to accommodate your schedule. BASIS teams begin by teaching one of the lessons from our database of kid-tested, teacher-approved lessons. Experienced volunteers may also take advantage of training opportunities to develop their own lesson.",BASIS,Active,,gabasis,https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/gabasis,"Graduate Student Organizations, Blue Heart Initiative Category",Bay Area Scientists Inspiring Students (BASIS) volunteers foster scientific curiosity by connecting with kids and teachers through hands-on classroom experiences.

Bahá’ís believe social change starts with spirituality — individuals increasing their capacity for service and working for the betterment of neighborhoods and communities. In line with the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith, the Berkeley Bahá’í Club works to promote the essential oneness of humanity; to foster a spirit of fellowship and love among all peoples; to break down the racial, religious and other prejudices that are the greatest barriers to peace and unity in the world today; and to bring about the betterment of the world through good deeds and service. Since a necessary element in effecting such a change is the individual, the Bahá’í Club tries to nurture individual spiritual growth through the development of moral values, an upright character and increased capacity for service. To these ends, the Berkeley Bahá’í Club organises divers activities and events, including: ■ study circles for the systematic study of Bahá’í Writings and thoughtful discussion of spiritual, philosophical and sociological topics; ■ devotional gatherings for sharing prayers and inspirational readings from all religious traditions in a peaceful setting; ■ talks & lectures from guest speakers on relevant topics; ■ service projects as a venue for transforming words into action; ■ inter-faith collaborations to promote the basic unity of all religions; ■ social events aimed at creating fellowship. Membership is open to all. All who have an interest in the Bahá’í Faith's community building activities, irrespective of religious affiliation, are more than welcome to attend meetings and events. “And the honor and distinction of the individual consist in this, that he among all the world’s multitudes should become a source of social good. Is any larger bounty conceivable than this, that an individual, looking within himself, should find that by the confirming grace of God he has become the cause of peace and well-being, of happiness and advantage to his fellow men?

BridgeUSA at Berkeley 💙,"The United States’ political climate needs drastic change. Politics has been rendered easy and dualistic, making blind-partisanship not only permissible, but the principal mode of political practice. It has become acceptable to immerse oneself in echo-chambers of like-mindedness, to label and blindly dismiss ideological opposites, and to violently rebuke instead of constructively disagreeing. There is no productive way forward so long as this persists. BridgeUSA wants to move the conversation forward, by allowing it to happen in the home of academic progress and innovation; the college campus. If we wish to create a better national sphere of politics, we need to start by creating better collegiate political spheres open to BridgeUSA’s guiding principles of responsible discourse, true diversity of ideas, and the creation of listening spaces. Our chapter will be at the forefront of this movement to fix national governance, by starting in the spaces where they learn, live, and grow into tomorrow’s leaders.

In 2009, involved campus student leaders, along with the statewide Lobby Day team, held their first student leadership meeting to brainstorm ways to structure the organization for the future. There was a general consensus that additional organization at the state level could be a useful tool for CaHPSA. The mission statement was developed from a rougher draft of the previous year. The core functions of the organization were agreed upon to be ""Educate – Advocate – Grow"" and statewide positions were developed from these core functions. CaHPSA at Berkeley too aligns with the belief ""health justice for all"" and endeavors to carrying the following goals: Support efforts to improve quality of and access to health care in California Provide opportunities for students to develop health advocacy and communication skills Educate and train future health and medical professionals to become effective health advocates Engender a sense of social responsibility among students Advocate for a single-payer health system We offer programs such as Project White Coat to certify students in helping more people enroll in health insurance and prepare for the annual Lobby Day which occurs in Sacramento.

Vision We envision a campus community free of violence and grounded in social justice. This vision will be realized when every member of our community is a beacon of support and respect for those around them. Values We believe prevention comes first. We know that with time and concerted efforts, violence is 100% preventable, and we believe that, as a UC Berkeley community, we have a moral imperative to prevent violence and suffering. We center survivors. Survivors began and are imperative to the movement to end sexual violence across the country; their experiences and perspectives are critical to healing and transforming our culture in genuine and meaningful ways. We are grounded in social justice. We understand that violence is rooted in oppression and that oppression is intersectional, so our approach must also be intersectional. We commit ourselves to expanding access, practicing inclusion, and undoing oppression wherever and whenever possible. We believe safety is a right. Every human in our community should receive respect for their bodily and emotional integrity and autonomy — always, in every situation. We practice self-care and kindness. Work grounded in these practices is more sustainable, effective, and transformative. We seek and value the wisdom of our community. We take a communal approach to our work, knowing that we are all learning from each other. We are optimistic and hopeful. We know that, as a community, we can eliminate violence and create the campus community we want. _______________________________________ Opened in 2014, the PATH to Care Center quickly became a cornerstone of support for UC Berkeley students, faculty, and staff. The Center’s first big milestone came when the Chancellor announced Berkeley would create a confidential advocate position, a crucial resource for survivors seeking services, as well as for those seeking to understand or pursue a university disciplinary process. Later in 2014, the first Bear Pact program launched, educating all incoming first-year and transfer undergraduate students about sexual violence prevention, with content designed and delivered by the University Health Services Health Promotion team. Following this, in the fall, the first advocate – who would go on to become the Center’s first director – was hired: Mari Knuth-Bouracee. The Center saw an immediate and overwhelming demand for services, which led to the ASUC and GA passing the Wellness Initiative Fee Referendum – a commitment of student fees funding several initiatives, including a new advocate position for the Center. This Referendum solidified the University’s commitment to expanding the Center’s resources for all who need them, and helped lead to rapid growth: two advocates were hired, sexual violence prevention education was included for the first time in graduate student education, and an Assistant Director for Prevention joined the Center’s team. With the rapid expansion and demand for services, the Center quickly grew out of its one-room office and into a new space that included two counseling rooms for client meetings, crucial for confidentiality, in early 2016. In mid-2016, the Center added an Assistant Director for Survivor Support, a Program Analyst, and two Prevention Program Managers. The need for the Center was clear – and in July, the US Office on Women’s Health awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department, to continue to expand this work. The Center then launched a peer education program, which began with the hiring of 11 peer educators, as well as a Care Line, the 24/7 crisis line for the University. Continuing its focus on graduate student sexual violence prevention, the Center hired its first Program Manager for Graduate Prevention. The Center also launched The Well, a Black healing space co-led by a Center advocate. Since its launch, the Center has continued to deepen its focus on both survivor support and prevention. By late 2017, videos created by the Center highlighting these practices had been shown to over 15,000 students, faculty and staff (and continue to be shown each year); the Center launched Yoga As Healing groups; and the Center received further recognition when the Office on Violence Against Women awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department. Another major milestone was successfully advocating for funding for a Prevention Manager for Staff and Faculty Programs; a role that was filled in 2018. Today, the Center continues to expand in both its staff capacity and in the services it provides, further solidifying its place as a key resource for the University.Contact us today for support!",,Active,,pathtocare,https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/pathtocare,,"The PATH to Care Center confidential advocates bring a holistic approach to supporting survivors.

Capital Investments at Berkeley,"Founded in 2012 and reincorporated in 2014, Capital Investments at Berkeley was created by and for students striving to obtain real trading experience and provide investors superior risk-adjusted returns. In a perpetually changing market environment, CIB prides itself in our creative approach to trading, implementing a wide variety of strategies using a large selection of financial instruments. Our investment philosophy is founded on the belief that capital preservation is more important than capital gains and in the long run a dynamic asset allocation and reactivity to market inefficiencies can generate above market returns. Further, we believe that as students, we have a unique perspective and differentiated views on markets, economies, and current events which provide rare opportunities for investors. Finally, we believe that as stewards of capital we have a deep responsibility to consider all stakeholders affected by our decisions, including our investors, employees of publicly traded companies, our communities, disadvantaged groups, the environment, and more. Only through active management and dedicated equity research can these responsibilities be fully materialized in investing. Our team leverages the unique skill-sets of our members and their varied academic and vocational backgrounds to deliver these returns to our partners. CIB draws on the combined experience of our members as employees of investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, federal regulatory agencies, technology companies, legal firms, and start-ups notably including Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Lazard, BlackRock, Blackstone, Centerview Partners, IMC, JMP Securities, the Federal Reserve, Dodge and Cox, Point72, Bain & Co., Vista Equity Partners, and Google. Our culture is data and performance driven; we combine the financial acumen of our veteran members with the entrepreneurial philosophy of our school to create dynamism within existing investment structures. This creativity and unique synthesis of information is the cornerstone of CIB’s idea generation. Our portfolio utilizes hedging strategies and a “risk-management first” approach to realize consistent returns that outperform the market. Trades are made through quantitative evaluation of a risk-reward profile and the ever-changing market environment. Capital Investments at Berkeley’s long term goals include achieving capital preservation and gains regardless of market conditions, maintaining our loyal investor base, continuing to leverage our extensive alumni network, and providing students interested in finance and investment management real world opportunities to create value and preparation for careers.",CIB,Active,,cib,https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/cib,"Professional Student Organizations, Undergraduate Organizations","Founded in 2012, CIB is a student-run investment fund and finance club at the University of California, Berkeley, dedicated to providing investing knowledge, experience, and training to students and superior risk-adjusted returns to investors."

Federalist Society at Berkeley Law,"Law schools and the legal profession are currently strongly dominated by a form of orthodox liberal ideology, which advocates a centralized and uniform society.

The society seeks both to promote an awareness of these principles and to further their application through its activities. The Berkeley Law chapter of the Federalist Society’s goals include: promoting thoughtful and challenging discussion of legal and public policy issues; academically and intellectually sponsoring conservative and libertarian law students; and ensuring that Berkeley Law students are thoughtfully exposed to conservative and libertarian perspectives and consider these perspectives in their analysis of legal issues.

Girls Into VC at Berkeley,"Historically, venture capital is a male-dominated field, lacking diversity on the investment team. Women account for only 9% of venture capitalists, 8% of firm partners, and 7% of board seats. This not only negatively affects women interested in the field, but also companies and entrepreneurs. Many women are not taught about venture capital, think joining the field is an unattainable goal, and are discouraged from joining clubs or startups because of their gender. As a result, women are not being invested in because women are not making these decisions. Girls Into VC at Berkeley is dedicated to increasing the number of women in venture capital. The organization is many things – an advocacy organization, a professional development network, and a supportive community of friends. Through the organization, members will learn about the field, build practical knowledge, grow their network in the industry, and gain a supportive community of women interested in VC! There will be education about venture capital, speaker events, pitch competitions to encourage female entrepreneurs, partnerships with firms and incubators, and more!

Historical Fencing Club of Berkeley 💙,"Welcome to The Historical Fencing Club of Berkeley, where we practice swordsmanship using realistically constructed and fully weighted sword replicas, protective equipment, and manuscripts written by fencing masters of old. We aim to reconstruct historical techniques and fighting systems for a wide array of weapons, including but not limited to the longsword, cavalry saber, and rapier. Our meetings involve both guided practice to learn skills and free sparring to put those skills to the test. Come try us out if you’d like to engage in combat in a safe and welcoming environment or just have fun handling a sword! We teach from a list of manuals, some of which are Keith Farrell's German Longsword Manual for longsword (adapted from the teachings of Johannes Liechtenaur), Fiore de’i Liberi’s Il Fior di Battaglia(c. 1400) for longsword and dagger, and Charles Roworth’s Art of Defence on Foot(1798) for cavalry saber. There is no independent study required for members(though you might find it valuable to read the source for something you’re confused about) and our instructors will give you all the information you need. We have no club dues, no application, no need for prior experience, and you don’t need to buy any gear. The club will provide everything you need to participate. While our instructors teach lessons that build upon each other, we welcome new members throughout the year and will be more than happy to get you up to speed on anything you’ve missed! You might have heard fencing associated with the Olympics and some of our members have backgrounds in sport fencing. In contrast to modern/sport/Olympic fencing, which trains to the rules of the sport in question, historical fencing and other Historical European Martial Arts(HEMA) train in practical swordsmanship for self-defense, dueling, or military contexts of the past. Look no further if you’d like to learn more about swordsmanship and its historical usage! Come join us on Memorial Glade every Saturday afternoon (weather permitting) for lessons and informal sparring!

Established in 1986, Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. continues to provide its members with a support system based on academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. The purpose of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. is to open the doors of opportunity to the Latinas of our community. Our primary focus is academic excellence and meeting the needs of Latina women in higher education. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. also promotes the advancement of Latinas through various campus activities and community services, and provides an environment for personal growth within a unit of sisterhood. Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc.'s priorities, however, will be placed upon academic excellence and community service. Divine Delta Chapter | University of California, Berkeley | Est. April 6, 1991 In the Spring of 1991 three strong, brave, and intelligent Latina women, Jennifer Garcia, Maria Martinez, and Rosalinda Valdez felt the need to establish an organization that supplemented their needs as women in higher education at UC Berkeley. This need led to the formation of the Delta chapter of Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc., and the establishment of the first Latina organization at UC Berkeley. Twenty-seven years later, the Delta chapter continues it's commitment to academic excellence, community service, and sisterhood. Although we are a Latina-based sorority, we accept applicants regardless of race or color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or handicap. Pillars Academic Excellence, Community Service, Sisterhood Traditions Stepping: In 1987 the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. first introduced stepping to ladies of Lambda Theta Nu sorority Inc. by inviting them to step on stage in a unity step. Our sisters at California State University, Chico added the use of machetes as a symbol of strength, a symbol with direct cultural ties. Machetes: In 1989 Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc. became the first sorority to incorporate the use of machetes in a stepping performance. The use of machetes has traditionally showcased the bravery of men. However, for Lambdas, breaking down this male-based tradition not only served as symbol of empowerment but also exemplified the determination of Latinas to integrate into every aspect of life that was not traditionally meant for Latinas. The incorporation of machetes in our performances personify our culture and our strength as women whose perseverance is multidimensional. Strolling: Strolling, also known as party walking, is a synchronized dance used to encourage commonalities among sisters and showcase our organization and/or to compete in shows.

"Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc.","On December 1, 1975, history was made – history on a college campus, which would transcend other colleges/universities throughout the United States; history which would have a positive impact on the Latino community and our nation; history which would forever change the Greek system, more specifically, the entity known as a fraternity. On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago. Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation. The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers.

And why now? Berkeley is famous for its student involvement with the social discourse and the individual unlearning processes of biases and stereotypes. However, the Architecture students of the CED represent a passionate, yet frustrated student body, regarding the diversity of architects studied, redundancy and hypocrisy in the curriculum, and the treatment of peers in the LGBTQ+ community.

We believe strongly in the cathartic powers of art, and the ability to empower and spread positivity and community using art as the medium. Hopefully, through our workshops, we can aid the children in their process of healing. -- By recruiting volunteers on campus, we hope to expand to more hospitals and increase the number of weekly workshops to form even more meaningful connections with kids who need it the most. -- If you would like to learn more about our club, we will be holding info sessions towards the beginning of each semester.

"Phi Beta Sigma, Fraternity Incorporated","Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three young African-American male students. The Founders, Honorable A. Langston Taylor, Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship, and service. The Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as “a part of” the general community rather than “apart from” the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence…without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the “inclusive we” rather than the “exclusive we”. From its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves and their immediate families, they held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity’s motto, “Culture For Service and Service For Humanity.” The fraternity exceeded the prevailing models of Black Greek-Letter fraternal organizations by being the first to establish alumni chapters, to establish youth mentoring clubs, to establish a federal credit union, to establish chapters in Africa, and establish a collegiate chapter outside of the United States, and is the only fraternity to hold a constitutional bond with a predominantly African-American sorority, Zeta Phi Beta (ΖΦΒ), which was founded on January 16, 1920, at Howard University in Washington, D.C., through the efforts of members of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity. The Outta Pocket Omicron Psi Chapter was chartered on January 25, 1985 on the campus of the University of California Berkeley by 7 men: Anthony Sykes, James Jackson, Marvin Gibson, Earl Watson, Norman Dawkins, Booker Crisp, Cedric Nellum.",PBS,Active,,phibetasigma,https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/phibetasigma,"ASUC Sponsored 2025-26-Student Activity Groups, CalGreeks National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) Fraternities & Sororities","Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914.

Phi Kappa Psi,"Over 150 years ago, two college students, William H. Letterman and Charles P.T. Moore, in the college town of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, were nursing and watching their stricken friends during an epidemic of typhoid fever. Through the long night vigils, an appreciation of the great joy of serving others came into their lives. Calling a number of others to join them, a Brotherhood was founded on February 19, 1852. It flourished, and gradually extended to other colleges and universities throughout the country. Pragmatic idealists, the founders of Phi Kappa Psi sought a new fraternity – a fraternity that should complement the work of the university by cultivating those humanities without which the educated man fails of his greatest usefulness, founded upon the great joy of serving others. The centennial anniversary Phi Kappa Psi was at the old home of the Widow Letterman in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, on February 19, 1952. Over 100 members of the Fraternity gathered together for this occasion including three of the grandsons of the Founders. A bronze tablet commemorating the centennial was moved to the Pennsylvania Alpha chapter house. In the Fraternity’s first 100 years, Phi Kappa Psi had grown to 56 chapters, 40 Alumni Associations and 40,000 initiates. Phi Kappa Psi today has ninety-seven chapters in thirty-four states and the District of Columbia with 4,778 active student members. There have been nearly 113,000 men initiated. Unlike most national fraternities, the constitution of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity vests control over its affairs in the student members through the election of six of the ten members of the Executive Council and voting control at the GAC.

"REACH! Asian and Asian Diaspora Recruitment and Retention Center (formerly known as ""REACH! Asian Pacific American RRC"")","In 1994, the Retention and Empowerment of Asian/Asian American Youths Considering Higher Education (REACH!) began with a handful of committed folks, as a program under the Asian Student Union (ASU) at UC Berkeley to target “Asian American*, high school students, especially those who are underrepresented, low-income, and non-college tracked”. Its goals were two-fold: 1) promoting higher education as an attainable goal and 2) empowering students through “building ethnic pride and programs that foster community activism and support APA* youth culture”. As REACH! grew organizationally, the vision and purpose of REACH! grew with it. While the mission remained, “the service and empowerment of recent immigrant and urban Asian Americans living in at-risk life situations,” we added on that “Our goal is to promote higher education as a means to empower ourselves and improve the economic and social conditions facing our communities.” We saw that REACH! had a unique role on campus and in the A/AA community at large, because REACH! was not just going to increase the numbers of underrepresented Asians at Berkeley but REACH! would be a training ground for future educators, activists, and leaders who would address society’s injustices through their life’s work. Thus, we created programs to raise political awareness, build coalitions, develop youth leaders, and build leadership in ourselves. Each year, programs have been refined and recreated by (insanely) dedicated and intelligent coordinators, who look for a better way to do things. However, our single most important legacy is the steady stream of community leaders we have and will produce. *As of May 1st, 2022, we have redirected our efforts from serving API communities to fully serve the Asian/Asian American communities.

Our mission is to provide youth from Berkeley, Oakland, and El Cerrito elementary schools we reach with a personal connection to mentors through academic and extracurricular activities in order to foster life skills and personal growth. Every semester, The Sage DeCal is offered to all mentors and is worth 1 unit. The classroom and mentoring portions of the class each run concurrently all the way through the semester, allowing the students to directly apply lessons learned in the classroom and utilize the classroom as a resource for issues that come up while mentoring. This course offers UC Berkeley students a unique opportunity to critically engage in the theory and practice of working with the youths in our community. This course will teach what it takes to be an effective mentor, tutor, and big brother or sister for their mentee. By the end of this course, students will be able to: 1. Develop the skills to forge strong personal relationships with the youths in our community 2. Think critically about the theory and practice of working with children 3. Learn and use pedagogical methods relevant to elementary age students 4. Recognize the potential legal and ethical boundaries a mentor must navigate 5.

Southeast Asian Student Coalition,"SASC Mission Statement: ""SASC’s founding in 2000 was initially focused on the refugee experience, which aimed to unite individuals bounded by the historical context of the American Wars in Southeast Asia. We hope to continue to preserve this space of growth and inclusivity. Together, our goal is to foster a space to explore Southeast Asian American identity and culture. As a coalition, we unite and empower our communities by addressing the social injustices, economic inequalities and political under-representation that our communities may face.” SASC Hxstory: In 2000, Professor Khatharya Um hosted a Southeast Asian Conference at UC Berkeley to commemorate the 25th year of the Southeast Asian diaspora after the war in Southeast Asia (more familiarly known as the Viet Nam War). She asked a few Southeast Asian UC Berkeley students in her class and some she knew to help get involved with the conference. Their role was to head up the youth portion of the conference. Using data information collected the conference Professor Um along with the UC Berkeley students developed the booklet that SASC has called A Dream Denied about Southeast Asians and their struggle to gain access to higher education. After the conference, the youth summit organizers, consisting of members from the Laotian, Hmong, Cambodian, and Vietnamese student groups felt connected and saw a need for a space/coalition to address issues across the community. They recognized that there were distinct groups that already existed to promote cultural awareness and knew that that was not one of their primary goals. They were also aware that they wanted the group to be more than just a student organization, but a coalition between the Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Laotian students coming together on common issues to strengthen the community as a whole, hence the name Southeast Asian Student Coalition. The name was created by the students as they sat at Sproul Fountain. Their goals at the time included greater promotion of higher education, community building between the different groups, outreaching to the larger community.At the time they believed that there was a niche that needed to be filled – an organization that would work with the different cultural groups as well as the recruitment and retention center to address the SEA community in particular. Their goal was to both build coalition as well as empowerment, and to step beyond the needs at Berkeley to incorporate the communities we came from. They went around the East Bay community asking and understanding what it is exactly that they can do. After all of that, in 2002 SASC Summer Institute was born. They wanted something where they can effectively outreach, teach, and learn to/from young people.Since then SASC has grown into a larger community and has expanded its reaches into the community. SASC’s current programs include SEA Grad, SEAMentorship, and SEA Prison Outreach Project.In 2005, a group of SASC folks had multiple meetings about the rebuilding of SASC, due to issues of sustainability and finding leaders in the community. From these meetings SASCommunity, a non-hierarchical committee, was created.

Students for Life at Berkeley 💙,"Students for Life at Berkeley: Mission Statement As UC Berkeley’s pro-life student group, Students for Life (BSL) recognizes the inherent and inviolable dignity of human life, from that of the unborn to that of the aged and terminally ill. We are dedicated to working within our campus and local community to put an end to abortion, embryonic stem cell research, and euthanasia. Since BSL is based at a prestigious educational institution, we see the need to educate our community about the truths surrounding offenses against human life. To that end, we facilitate and engage in intellectual discussion on relevant issues, challenging widely held relativist assumptions on the dignity of human life, the role of individual autonomy, and society's role in protecting human life. We seek to engage both the minds and hearts of UC Berkeley's student population as well as those of our surrounding communities in addressing these issues. We desire to change the prevailing mindset in today's society so that it might be more receptive to a culture of life that fully recognizes the dignity of every human being. Furthermore, we aim to form leaders that will encourage the development of a more just society grounded in the recognition of the inherent and transcendent value of human life. We seek to enter our respective professions armed with the knowledge and tools needed to uphold the dignity of life in every facet of society. Also at the heart of BSL’s mission is its commitment to community service. We believe that socioeconomic circumstances do not justify the taking of human life, and we affirm that such difficulties can be overcome. To that end, BSL provides information to assist women facing crisis pregnancies and refers them to local crisis pregnancy centers that provide women with what they need to bring new life into the world. We also volunteer at local crisis pregnancy centers to help promote their mission to encourage the cherishing and welcoming of new life into our community. Though the focus of our outreach is primarily local, we collaborate with other pro-life organizations from across our state and nation and are united to them by virtue of our common cause. As a member of Students for Life of America (SFLA), BSL engages in the fight for life at the state and national level. As an organization that concerns itself with matters of great public relevance, BSL strives to do everything in its capacity to shape public opinion on relevant university, state, and federal policies, as well as to influence said policies, so that these might more accurately reflect our vision for a world in which every human life is valued and protected.",BSL,Active,,berkeleystudentsforlife,https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/berkeleystudentsforlife,"ASUC Sponsored 2025-26-Student Activity Groups, Political & Advocacy Student Organizations, Undergraduate Organizations, Blue Heart Initiative Category","Students for Life at Berkeley recognizes the inherent, inviolable dignity of human life in all its forms.

Please fill out our interest form for the next upcoming cycle! https://youtu.be/hsomGwJ6jvM VHIO strives to eliminate language barriers in healthcare settings by providing trained volunteer interpreters from UC Berkeley to healthcare organizations and facilities for underserved, limited English proficient (LEP) communities in the Bay Area. VHIO is a University of California, Berkeley undergraduate student-led organization whose roots trace back to 2007, when it was established as the San Francisco Hepatitis B Collaborative (SFHBC) in partnership with University of California, San Francisco health professional students. SFHBC at Berkeley provided trained bilingual students as Asian language interpreters for two monthly UCSF hepatitis B student-run clinics, which we continue to volunteer at. Dedicated to helping stop the spread of Hepatitis B, SFHBC partnered with organizations such as the San Francisco Hepatitis B Free Campaign and helped at various screening, vaccination, and education events. Four hundred million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B infection, which tragically can lead to liver cancer early in adult life. It is the 10th leading etiologic cause of death in the world. Fortunately, the spread of the hepatitis B virus is preventable with a simple, safe, and effective vaccine. Due to an increase in demand for interpretation services, we have been expanding to provide interpretation and volunteering services for a broader range of issues beyond hepatitis B. In August 2010, SFHBC at Berkeley was renamed the Volunteer Health Interpreters Organization (VHIO) to reflect its expanded scope of language capacities and its service base across the San Francisco Bay Area. We provide trained volunteer interpreters in several languages - Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Hindi-Urdu, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese - from UC Berkeley to healthcare organizations and facilities for underserved LEP communities. We work closely with UCSF medical and pharmacy students, UOP dental students, health workers, and medical providers to serve patients and help them overcome the language barrier in healthcare. VHIO plays an integral role in our community by outreaching to the underserved immigrant neighborhoods and assisting them at individual medical appointments and health fairs. Passionate about community empowerment, our volunteers also interpret for educational presentations on topics ranging from cancer prevention to disaster preparedness. VHIO provides the following valuable experiences for pre-health students.
