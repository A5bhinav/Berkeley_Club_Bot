    "Description": "<p><strong>ACS About Us</strong></p>\r\n<p>The American Constitution Society (ACS) believes that law should be a force to improve the lives of all people. ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shaping Debate</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country&rsquo;s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates &ldquo;intellectual capital&rdquo; for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.</p>\r\n<p>The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as &ldquo;originalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;strict construction&rdquo; that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Building Networks</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;One of the American Constitution Society&rsquo;s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.</p>\r\n<p>The engine that drives the organization&rsquo;s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The strength of ACS&rsquo;s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken&rsquo;s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that &ldquo;Originalism isn&rsquo;t a pillar of our constitutional history; it&rsquo;s a talking point;&rdquo; and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.</p>",

In 2002, UC Berkeley-ANS sponsored the National Student Conference for ANS and the conference was a tremendous success in bringing together students from all over the country to present information on latest technology in the field and to foster interaction between like-minded current and future scientists.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Our Mission</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\">The American Nuclear Society serves its members in their efforts to develop and safely apply nuclear science and technology for public benefit through knowledge exchange, professional development, and enhanced public understanding.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\">To receive our periodic emails about upcoming events and opportunities, please subscribe to our mailing list at&nbsp;<a href=\"/actioncenter/organization/americannuclearsociety/tinyurl.com/ANS-MailingList\">tinyurl.com/ANS-MailingList</a> and check out our website at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ans.nuc.berkeley.edu\">https://ans.nuc.berkeley.edu</a></p>",

On this campus&mdash;where 42% of students&nbsp;identified as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) in 2008&mdash;there was not a single academic course devoted to the study of health in AAPI communities. The AAPI Health Research Group (AAPIHRG) was formed in 2008 to fill this void. The purpose of this&nbsp;group is to share our journey and findings in AAPI community health with other students and community professionals who may wish to join us or contribute to the work.</p>\r\n<p>Although the aggregate data for our community paints a picture of a healthy population, we know that good health is not enjoyed by all. Our community is not homogeneous. The diversity of the many ethnic groups that make up the AAPI community presents challenges in obtaining accurate data. Students who come from these diverse backgrounds can be an important conduit in raising our awareness of health problems that exist in these communities. This can foster a deeper understanding of health in the broader AAPI community.</p>\r\n<p>Besides the 4-unit Spring course (ASAMST 190 - \"Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Community Health: Foundational Theories &amp; Contemporary Issues\"), we are inviting you to take part in our next steps as we develop&nbsp;as a student organization. We are open <strong>to all students</strong> interested in community health and specifically the AAPI community. We hope that through&nbsp;this organization, we foster in students a desire to serve the community as well as provide opportunities for leadership development and networking.</p>\r\n<p>We invite your participation in AAPIHRG as a student or as a health professional sharing the following vision and mission:</p>\r\n<p><strong>VISION</strong></p>\r\n<p>A healthy community can only exist within a healthy society. We strive to improve the health of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities through research and service within the community and through social activism in society.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MISSION</strong></p>\r\n<p>The AAPI Health Research Group was formed in the spring of 2008. The purpose is to encourage students to engage in AAPI community health in the following five areas:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>diversity of the AAPI communities</li>\r\n<li>historical perspective</li>\r\n<li>epidemiological perspective</li>\r\n<li>medical perspective</li>\r\n<li>social change</li>\r\n</ol>",

    "Description": "<p>Innovative Design is a family of designers, photographers, web developers, and videographers at the University of California, Berkeley. We are creative individuals who are continuously evolving by collaborating, inspiring, and educating one another.&nbsp;It is through our different artistic tools and talents that we are able to create novel photography and designs for our peers and professional clients.</p>\r\n<p>We provide pro-bono creative services and teach popular DeCals to the Cal community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Website:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.innovativedesign.club/\">https://www.innovativedesign.club/</a><a href=\"http://innovativedesign.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><br /></a></p>\r\n<p><em>Creative Services<br /></em>Innovative Design&nbsp;has three disciplines: Graphic Design, Photography, and Web Design. Throughout the semester, we also host several educational and industry events.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><em>Graphic Design</em>: There are three graphic design tiers, Beginner, Gold, and Blue Tier. Blue tier is a group of intermediate to advanced designers that offers more professional design services while Gold tier offers graphic design education and experience for beginner to intermediate designers as they service on-campus groups and professional clients. Beginner tier is composed of beginner designers who has little to no experience in graphic design.</li>\r\n<li><em>Photography</em>: There are three photography tiers, Beginner, Gold, and Blue Tier. Photography disciplines&nbsp;provide members hands-on experience as they provide photography services such as shooting professional headshots, event photography, stock photos, and more.</li>\r\n<li><em>Web</em>: There are two web design tiers, Beginner and Gold. Web Gold members work for clients that are in need of technical help in designing their websites. Gold members learn new skills and put existing knowledge to use through hands-on experience.Beginner tier is composed of beginner designers who has little to no experience in web design.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<div><em>DeCals&nbsp;</em></div>\r\n<div>Innovative Design teaches 3 DeCals:</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><em>Introduction to Photoshop and Illustrator<br /></em>This introductory course teaches graphic design through the use of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. This class is built for students who do not have any prior experience or knowledge of these programs.&nbsp;We work with students in developing a thorough understanding of these programs with weekly lessons and hands-on tutorials. In addition, students complete relevant homework exercises which aim to give students the opportunity to practice tools, develop original designs, and channel their creativity. Lastly, we explore graphic design trends, principles, and applications.</li>\r\n<li><em>Graphic Design Principles</em><br />This is a technical course in which students are taught extensive knowledge of Adobe programs (such as Illustrator and/or Photoshop). The class also covers conceptual and theoretical aspects of design such as color theory, branding, and user interface design.&nbsp;At the end of the course, students have a portfolio of work showcasing extensive knowledge on several design topics and an understanding of various elements of design.</li>\r\n<li><em>Photography Principles</em><br />This DeCal is for students interested in learning photography. We start off with the basics (camera manipulations and shooting in RAW) and quickly move onto composition rules and tricks to get better, more thought out photos, and from there move onto how to be a professional photographer, photo ethics, and integrating art into photography. By the end, students will feel strong in their photographic abilities, be able to critique their own work, and see the world through an artistic eye, so they can further grow as a photographer.&nbsp;It is intended to be for beginners with little to no knowledge of how to use a dSLR or other camera with manual capabilities.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Throughout the year, Innovative Design hosts a variety of events, from our annual designathon CMYK: Come Make Your MarK, speaker and workshop series RGB: Reach / Grow / Build, and an educational weekend series of creative workshops HEX: Hone and EXplore. Check out&nbsp;our Instagram or website for our most up-to-date announcements!&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>",

Here are some of our current projects:</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ethical Eats</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\">&nbsp;centers around giving students access to sustainable restaurants. Our website grants sustainability ratings to local Berkeley eateries. This semester we are working toward creating a website to\r\n increase student awareness regarding restaurant sustainability, as well as to help restaurants work to become more sustainable.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Another program STeam began is </span><strong>Environmental Justice and Education\r\n</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\">(EJ&amp;E), where we teach a 5-week long curriculum that we create to elementary aged students in the area.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Last semester we launched our </span><strong>Green Event Fund</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> project, where we created and implemented criteria through which we can fund other RSOs as they demonstrate how they are working\r\n to be more sustainable. This program funds events, projects, printing, and anything else an RSO may need money in order to do more sustainably.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Finally, STeam organizes </span><strong>Sunstock</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, a solar-powered music festival held on campus annually. STeam works hard year-round to prepare a venue, local lineup, sponsors, merchandise,\r\n and cuisine. Sunstock aims to unite students through music in an environmentally conscious way that brings light to improvements the music industry can make to be more sustainable. Our wide range of project niches displays how sustainability can be brought\r\n into all aspects of life and even combined with personal passions!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">We are always open to new ideas.

More, please!\" is the top comment from teachers who've had a&nbsp;BASIS visit.</p>\r\n<h2>Program Goals</h2>\r\n<p>The goals of BASIS are to (1) connect a diverse range of scientist volunteers to&nbsp;elementary school students and teachers, (2) inspire students with examples of&nbsp;real-world science careers and issues, (3) engage with students in hands-on, inquiry&nbsp;based learning experiences, and (4) create effective teaching links between&nbsp;scientists and public elementary schools in the East Bay.</p>\r\n<h2>Program Mechanics</h2>\r\n<p>UC Berkeley science and engineering students interested in becoming a BASIS&nbsp;volunteer must first sign up for a one-hour on-campus orientation (held on campus). Sign up for an orientation online&nbsp;(<a href=\"http://www.crscience.org/volunteers/signup\">http://www.crscience.org/volunteers/signup</a>).</p>\r\n<p>BASIS volunteers then form a teaching team (or join a pre-existing team)&nbsp;comprised of friends and colleagues in their field of study. Volunteers choose dates&nbsp;and times that they are available to visit classrooms and present a one-hour hands-on, inquiry-based lesson with their team. BASIS ensures that these lessons are age-appropriate and aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).&nbsp;Teams generally present in one classroom per month over the course of a school&nbsp;year (~10 lessons/year) though there is a high degree of flexibility to accommodate&nbsp;your schedule.</p>\r\n<p>BASIS teams begin by teaching one of the lessons from our database of kid-tested,&nbsp;teacher-approved lessons. Experienced volunteers may also take advantage of&nbsp;training opportunities to develop their own lesson.</p>",

    "Description": "<p>BSJ is the premier undergraduate research journal of the University of California, Berkeley. Every semester, our undergraduate staff publishes independent research done by undergraduates at UC Berkeley, interviews with faculty members, and features articles on current issues in science. All research papers and features articles are reviewed by faculty members. The initial purpose of the journal was to provide an official forum in which Berkeley undergraduates could publish their independent research. But since its inception in 1996, the purpose of the journal has expanded to give the Berkeley scientific community a&nbsp;better understanding of how events here at Berkeley impact global concerns. The focus of the journal is broad, spanning scientific disciplines ranging from ecology to engineering, from astronomy to biochemistry. Our intended audience includes, but is not limited to, UC Berkeley students, faculty, and the surrounding community. A new issue of BSJ is published&nbsp;twice a year in print and on our website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>See our website, bsj.studentorg.berkeley.edu, for more information on the journal, and decal.berkeley.edu for a link to our application. You must submit an application to our DeCal for consideration as part of our journal; we do not accept membership requests through CalLink.</p>",

They wanted to create a new model for intellectual-professional organizations on campus where students from all majors and backgrounds are encouraged to bring their best ideas about business, finance, economics and community without politics or peer pressure.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since then, BRB has strived to be the thought leader in business and financial literacy on campus. We are a student-led organization that publishes articles, interviews, and videos for people interested in business and finance-related content. Through its partnerships with other on-campus organizations and faculty, we seek to simplify the Berkeley business landscape while preparing its members with the technical expertise and writing skills that are demanded for their futures in finance and journalism.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Want to learn more about Business Review at Berkeley? Check out our instagram (@businessreviewberkeley) for more recruitment information!&nbsp;We look forward to welcoming new members soon!</p>",

We strive to make dragon boating more accessible to the students of UC Berkeley and recruit student-athletes twice a year. We are extremely proud to be one of the top college teams in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Dragon boating is a water sport in which a canoe-shaped boat of up to twenty people paddle together in synchronized rhythm to make the boat move, emulating a soaring dragon. Usually, races are 200, 500 or 2000 meters in length. Dragon boating is traditionally observed during the Chinese Duan Wu festival. However, it is now a much more common year-round activity and is one of the fastest-growing sports throughout the world.</p>\r\n<p>We are not recruiting Fall 2020 due to Covid, but will still have engagement videos and events for people interested in Cal DB and especially those interested in trying out Spring 2021.

Parker Duncan, the first Medical Student Fellow, was extremely involved in the development of the student leaders during these years.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, involved campus student leaders, along with the statewide Lobby Day team, held their first student leadership meeting to brainstorm ways to structure the organization for the future. There was a general consensus that additional organization at the state level could be a useful tool for CaHPSA. The mission statement was developed from a rougher draft of the previous year. The core functions of the organization were agreed upon to be \"Educate &ndash; Advocate &ndash; Grow\" and statewide positions were developed from these core functions.</p>\r\n<p>CaHPSA at Berkeley too aligns with the belief \"health justice for all\" and endeavors to carrying the following goals:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Support efforts to improve quality of and access to health care in California</li>\r\n<li>Provide opportunities for students to develop health advocacy and communication skills</li>\r\n<li>Educate and train future health and medical professionals to become effective health advocates</li>\r\n<li>Engender a sense of social responsibility among students</li>\r\n<li>Advocate for a single-payer health system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We offer programs such as Project White Coat to certify students in helping more people enroll in health insurance and prepare for the annual Lobby Day which occurs in Sacramento.

We collaborate with the campus community to make social change with the goals of preventing, intervening in, and responding to harassment and violence, eliminating oppression, and creating the culture and environment we all aspire to and deserve.</p>\r\n<h2>Vision</h2>\r\n<p>We envision a campus community free of violence and grounded in social justice. This vision will be realized when every member of our community is a beacon of support and respect for those around them.</p>\r\n<h2>Values</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>We believe prevention comes first.</strong></em>&nbsp;We know that with time and concerted efforts, violence is 100% preventable, and we believe that, as a UC Berkeley community, we have a moral imperative to prevent violence and suffering.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>We center survivors.</strong></em>&nbsp;Survivors began and are imperative to the movement to end sexual violence across the country; their experiences and perspectives are critical to healing and transforming our culture in genuine and meaningful ways.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>We are grounded in social justice.</strong></em>&nbsp;We understand that violence is rooted in oppression and that oppression is intersectional, so our approach must also be intersectional. We commit ourselves to expanding access, practicing inclusion, and undoing oppression wherever and whenever possible.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>We believe safety is a right.</strong></em>&nbsp;Every human in our community should receive respect for their bodily and emotional integrity and autonomy &mdash; always, in every situation.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>We practice self-care and kindness.</strong></em>&nbsp;Work grounded in these practices is more sustainable, effective, and transformative.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>We seek and value the wisdom of our community.</strong></em>&nbsp;We take a communal approach to our work, knowing that we are all learning from each other.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>We are optimistic and hopeful.</em></strong>&nbsp;We know that, as a community, we can eliminate violence and create the campus community we want.</p>\r\n<p><br />_______________________________________<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>Opened in 2014, the PATH to Care Center quickly became a cornerstone of support for UC Berkeley students, faculty, and staff. The Center&rsquo;s first big milestone came when the Chancellor announced Berkeley would create a confidential advocate position, a crucial resource for survivors seeking services, as well as for those seeking to understand or pursue a university disciplinary process.</p>\r\n<p>Later in 2014, the first Bear Pact program launched, educating all incoming first-year and transfer undergraduate students about sexual violence prevention, with content designed and delivered by the University Health Services Health Promotion team. Following this, in the fall, the first advocate &ndash; who would go on to become the Center&rsquo;s first director &ndash; was hired: Mari Knuth-Bouracee.</p>\r\n<p>The Center saw an immediate and overwhelming demand for services, which led to the ASUC and GA passing the Wellness Initiative Fee Referendum &ndash; a commitment of student fees funding several initiatives, including a new advocate position for the Center. This Referendum solidified the University&rsquo;s commitment to expanding the Center&rsquo;s resources for all who need them, and helped lead to rapid growth: two advocates were hired, sexual violence prevention education was included for the first time in graduate student education, and an Assistant Director for Prevention joined the Center&rsquo;s team. With the rapid expansion and demand for services, the Center quickly grew out of its one-room office and into a new space that included two counseling rooms for client meetings, crucial for confidentiality, in early 2016.</p>\r\n<p>In mid-2016, the Center added an Assistant Director for Survivor Support, a Program Analyst, and two Prevention Program Managers. The need for the Center was clear &ndash; and in July, the US Office on Women&rsquo;s Health awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department, to continue to expand this work.</p>\r\n<p>The Center then launched a peer education program, which began with the hiring of 11 peer educators, as well as a Care Line, the 24/7 crisis line for the University. Continuing its focus on graduate student sexual violence prevention, the Center hired its first Program Manager for Graduate Prevention. The Center also launched The Well, a Black healing space co-led by a Center advocate.</p>\r\n<p>Since its launch, the Center has continued to deepen its focus on both survivor support and prevention. By late 2017, videos created by the Center highlighting these practices had been shown to over 15,000 students, faculty and staff (and continue to be shown each year); the Center launched Yoga As Healing groups; and the Center received further recognition when the Office on Violence Against Women awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department. Another major milestone was successfully advocating for funding for a Prevention Manager for Staff and Faculty Programs; a role that was filled in 2018. Today, the Center continues to expand in both its staff capacity and in the services it provides, further solidifying its place as a key resource for the University.<br /><br />Contact us today for support!</p>\r\n</div>",

In a perpetually changing market environment, CIB prides itself in our creative approach to trading, implementing a wide variety of strategies using a large selection of financial instruments.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our investment philosophy is founded on the belief that capital preservation is more important than capital gains and in the long run a dynamic asset allocation and reactivity to market inefficiencies can generate above market returns. Further, we believe that as students, we have a unique perspective and differentiated views on markets, economies, and current events which provide rare opportunities for investors. Finally, we believe that as stewards of capital we have a deep responsibility to consider all stakeholders affected by our decisions, including our investors, employees of publicly traded companies, our communities, disadvantaged groups, the environment, and more. Only through active management and dedicated equity research can these responsibilities be fully materialized in investing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our team leverages the unique skill-sets of our members and their varied academic and vocational backgrounds to deliver these returns to our partners. CIB draws on the combined experience of our members as employees of investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, federal regulatory agencies, technology companies, legal firms, and start-ups notably including Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Lazard, BlackRock, Blackstone, Centerview Partners, IMC, JMP Securities, the Federal Reserve, Dodge and Cox, Point72, Bain &amp; Co., Vista Equity Partners, and Google.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our culture is data and performance driven; we combine the financial acumen of our veteran members with the entrepreneurial philosophy of our school to create dynamism within existing investment structures. This creativity and unique synthesis of information is the cornerstone of CIB&rsquo;s idea generation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our portfolio utilizes hedging strategies and a &ldquo;risk-management first&rdquo; approach to realize consistent returns that outperform the market. Trades are made through quantitative evaluation of a risk-reward profile and the ever-changing market environment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Capital Investments at Berkeley&rsquo;s long term goals include achieving capital preservation and gains regardless of market conditions, maintaining our loyal investor base, continuing to leverage our extensive alumni network, and providing students interested in finance and investment management real world opportunities to create value and preparation for careers.</p>",
    "Summary": "Founded in 2012, CIB is a student-run investment fund and finance club at the University of California, Berkeley, dedicated to providing investing knowledge, experience, and training to students and superior risk-adjusted returns to investors.",

We are Cal Concrete Canoe, UC Berkeley&rsquo;s first civil engineering competition team. We provide a welcoming community where students can learn, gain hands-on experience, and create something they can be proud of. Concrete canoe competes annually in the ASCE-sponsored concrete canoe competition, where we are challenged to apply knowledge from our courses and experience from our team to a large-scale project.</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>The concrete canoe team is unique from other student organizations because we encompass many disciplines of engineering; participating in our team exposes students to disciplines like construction, materials science, structural analysis, and environmental engineering. In addition, as a competition team, we help individuals grow and build leadership and teamwork skills. Despite being a civil engineering competition team, we welcome students from all majors and backgrounds; this diversity helps bring new ideas and concepts towards our project and competition!</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>Our team is comprised of divisions, each specializing in a subject to allow for our team to function:<br />&bull; Construction<br />&bull; Materials Design<br />&bull; Hull Design and Structural Analysis<br />&bull; Graphics Design<br />&bull; Paddling</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>Our team holds a long history of success in our competition, and with our continuous alumni support, we enable students to call upon a large, knowledgeable alumni network. In our team, students have the ability to grow outside of their courses!</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>If you are interested in joining us, please join our discord:&nbsp;https://discord.gg/Vbw2hNhZ</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

UC Berkeley students will be given a chance to expand their understanding of medicine as well as health-related hardships of living in third-world countries while increasing awareness of the lack of healthcare in such countries by providing care and information for the betterment of the nation.

We promote community involvement beyond campus borders by hosting collaborative events with organizations such as the Native American Health Center, Intertribal Friendship House, and the American Indian Child Resource Center.</p>\r\n<p>INC works to create and to provide a variety of support programs and resources for Native American, Indigenous, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander students at UC Berkeley in order to help them succeed and ultimately graduate. Our organization aims to establish a support system at Cal by providing safe spaces on campus as well as collaborating with other on-campus organizations. INC-RRC plays a key role in helping students balance individual success at Cal while maintaining pride in their heritage(s). Members of INC set an example for younger Native and Indigenous students, demonstrating that they can get here and also be successful in this competitive environment.

Edgar Mitchell was a part of the Apollo 14 mission and was the sixth person to walk on the moon.<br /><br />Kappa Sigma is returning this Fall of 2025 and are looking for any interested outstanding men to come out to rush. The Beta Xi chapter of Kappa Sigma rechartered in Spring 2024 and is now reinstated in Spring 2025. We currently have a group of 30+ guys consisting of many different years and majors. Many of our brothers are interested in a variety of activities such as weight lifting, barbecuing, sports, climbing, hiking, and more!<br /><br />As we are a new fraternity, we are looking to start new traditions and events here at Cal and we want to branch out into all aspects of student life such as philanthropy, sports, and academics. We want to contend in competitive intramural teams like soccer, football, and basketball. We also have a full year of fun brotherhood events like retreats, road trips, barbecues, and date parties!<br /><br />If you are interested in meeting the brothers and becoming a part of an amazing community then come on out to our Rush events (@calkappasigma), meet the brothers and learn about what it means to be a brother of Kappa Sigma.

They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.<br /><br />On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.<br /><br />Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.<br /><br />Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.</span></p>",

If you're interested in problem writing, all you need is to join the discord server, verify yourself, DM an admin or a member of leadership for the 'problem writing' role and you can start attending meetings (dates/times announced in the server). Those interested in logistics will need to verify themselves in the discord and fill out a brief Google form; we'll then organize a low-stakes brief coffee chat just to get to know a little bit about you and your specific interests. The interest form will be posted on our discord server.<strong> If you have any questions, please feel free to email us at <em>team@berkeley.mt.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>---&nbsp;</p>",

As we explore the legal field and take important steps towards law school admission, we learn to work successfully alongside one another, developing broad interpersonal skills, tolerance, and mutual respect for our brothers and sisters.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cultivating Professionalism</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our fraternity wants to do more than simply create a space where students interested in the law can come together. We want to provide our members with the skills and knowledge to go on to law school, careers in the legal field, and any other professional aspiration they may have. Through our Membership Development program, our professional events, and our many networking opportunities, members will find themselves graduating with a plethora of tools for their futures.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Investing Service</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law is not a field solely aimed at making money and gaining influence. Members of PAD find that we put just as much emphasis on the fairness and equity of law. To that end, our members take the skills they've acquired at Berkeley and in our fraternity to help the wider community and make a positive impact in the lives of others. Our Philanthropy committee makes it a point to provide accessible opportunities to reinvest time into making a difference.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Promoting Fraternalism</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PAD may be a place to hone your skills for the future, but ask any member and they will say that one of the most important pieces of PAD for them is the community. By creating an environment where new and old members can get to know each other and form lasting friendships and meaningful connections, our fraternity ensures that, by joining, you become a part of the biggest family at Cal.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Encouraging Leadership</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We take pride in giving members the tools they need to become leaders in the fraternity, on campus, and beyond. After the completion of Membership Development, new members have the opportunity to become more involved by applying to committee directorships. Others take the skills they've learned to become active in other organizations. We've had PAD members take leadership roles in the ASUC, Daily Californian, Undergraduate Political Science Association, Berkeley Project, and many many more.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/448726633\">Recruitment Video</a></p>",

    "Description": "<p>Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three young African-American male students. The Founders, Honorable A. Langston Taylor, Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship, and service.</p>\r\n<p>The Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as &ldquo;a part of&rdquo; the general community rather than &ldquo;apart from&rdquo; the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence&hellip;without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the &ldquo;inclusive we&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;exclusive we&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>From its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves and their immediate families, they held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity&rsquo;s motto, &ldquo;Culture For Service and Service For Humanity.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The fraternity exceeded the prevailing models of Black Greek-Letter fraternal organizations by being the first to establish alumni chapters, to establish youth mentoring clubs, to establish a federal credit union, to establish chapters in Africa, and establish a collegiate chapter outside of the United States, and is the only fraternity to hold a constitutional bond with a predominantly African-American sorority, Zeta Phi Beta (&Zeta;&Phi;&Beta;), which was founded on January 16, 1920, at Howard University in Washington, D.C., through the efforts of members of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Outta Pocket Omicron Psi Chapter was chartered on January 25, 1985 on the campus of the University of California Berkeley by 7 men: Anthony Sykes, James Jackson, Marvin Gibson, Earl Watson, Norman Dawkins, Booker Crisp, Cedric Nellum.<br /></strong></p>",

    "Description": "\r\n<p>Over 150 years ago, two college students, William H. Letterman and Charles P.T. Moore, in the college town of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, were nursing and watching their stricken friends during an epidemic of typhoid fever. Through the long night vigils, an\r\n appreciation of the great joy of serving others came into their lives. Calling a number of others to join them, a Brotherhood was founded on February 19, 1852. It flourished, and gradually extended to other colleges and universities throughout the country.\r\n Pragmatic idealists, the founders of Phi Kappa Psi sought a new fraternity – a fraternity that should complement the work of the university by cultivating those humanities without which the educated man fails of his greatest usefulness, founded upon the great\r\n joy of serving others.</p>\r\n<p>The centennial anniversary Phi Kappa Psi was at the old home of the Widow Letterman in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, on February 19, 1952. Over 100 members of the Fraternity gathered together for this occasion including three of the grandsons of the Founders.\r\n A bronze tablet commemorating the centennial was moved to the Pennsylvania Alpha chapter house. In the Fraternity’s first 100 years, Phi Kappa Psi had grown to 56 chapters, 40 Alumni Associations and 40,000 initiates. Phi Kappa Psi today has ninety-seven chapters\r\n in thirty-four states and the District of Columbia with 4,778 active student members. There have been nearly 113,000 men initiated. Unlike most national fraternities, the constitution of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity vests control over its affairs in the student\r\n members through the election of six of the ten members of the Executive Council and voting control at the GAC. The Endowment Fund of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity is a foundation that provides financial support for education programs of the Fraternity and financial\r\n support through scholarships and grants to its members. The Endowment Fund has approximately $50 million in assets, and ranks largest among the endowments established by other fraternity and sorority organizations.</p>\r\n",

Its goals were two-fold: 1) promoting higher education as an attainable goal and 2) empowering students through &ldquo;building ethnic pride and programs that foster community activism and support APA* youth culture&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>As REACH! grew organizationally, the vision and purpose of REACH! grew with it. While the mission remained, &ldquo;the service and empowerment of recent immigrant and urban Asian Americans living in at-risk life situations,&rdquo; we added on that &ldquo;Our goal is to promote higher education as a means to empower ourselves and improve the economic and social conditions facing our communities.&rdquo; We saw that REACH! had a unique role on campus and in the A/AA community at large, because REACH! was not just going to increase the numbers of underrepresented Asians at Berkeley but REACH! would be a training ground for future educators, activists, and leaders who would address society&rsquo;s injustices through their life&rsquo;s work. Thus, we created programs to raise political awareness, build coalitions, develop youth leaders, and build leadership in ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>Each year, programs have been refined and recreated by (insanely) dedicated and intelligent coordinators, who look for a better way to do things. However, our single most important legacy is the steady stream of community leaders we have and will produce.</p>\r\n<p>*As of May 1st, 2022, we have redirected our efforts from serving API communities to fully serve the Asian/Asian American communities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>This group [REACH!

The program is meant to build &ldquo;real&rdquo; connections, which with consistent time and effort by the mentors, will turn into powerful relationships. The program&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to provide youth with a personal connection to mentors through academic and extracurricular activities in order to foster life skills and personal growth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">Sage matches hundreds of committed UC Berkeley students to an elementary school-aged mentee each year. Our mission is to provide youth from Berkeley, Oakland, and El Cerrito elementary schools we reach with a personal connection to mentors through academic and extracurricular activities in order to foster life skills and personal growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">Every semester, The Sage DeCal is offered to all mentors and is worth 1 unit. The classroom and mentoring portions of the class each run concurrently all the way through the semester, allowing the students to directly apply lessons learned in the classroom and utilize the classroom as a resource for issues that come up while mentoring. This course offers UC Berkeley students a unique opportunity to critically engage in the theory and practice of working with the youths in our community. This course will teach what it takes to be an effective mentor, tutor, and big brother or sister for their mentee. By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">1. Develop the skills to forge strong personal relationships with the youths in our community</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">2. Think critically about the theory and practice of working with children</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">3. Learn and use pedagogical methods relevant to elementary age students</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">4. Recognize the potential legal and ethical boundaries a mentor must navigate</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">5. Apply team-building and leadership training to collaborate on a group project</p>",

Integrity, sound judgment and loyalty are all lofty goals that can occasionally be found contradictory to the impulses of\r\n collegiate life. Our fraternity provides a medium for character development that assists young men in developing the qualities of their character. Our direct input in developing American leaders is so thorough that on June 13, 2005, Sigma Chi was the first\r\n Greek-letter society to be honored by the United States Congress for the fraternity's 150th anniversary.</p>\r\n<p>The Alpha Beta Chapter here at the University of California, Berkeley was the first Sigma Chi chapter to be founded on the West Coast. Started in 1886 with the help of former Confederate General Harry St. John Dixon, our fraternity expanded to all corners\r\n of the United States. In 1913, the fraternity moved into its current location on the corner of College and Channing. The house is a block away from the biggest dining hall at Cal, Crossroads, and only two blocks away from campus.

    "Description": "<p><strong>SASC Mission Statement:</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>\"SASC&rsquo;s founding in 2000 was initially focused on the refugee experience, which aimed to unite individuals bounded by the historical context of the American Wars in Southeast Asia. We hope to continue to preserve this space of growth and inclusivity. Together, our goal is to foster a space to explore Southeast Asian American identity and culture. As a coalition, we unite and empower our communities by addressing the social injustices, economic inequalities and political under-representation that our communities may face.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SASC Hxstory:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In 2000, Professor Khatharya Um hosted a Southeast Asian Conference at UC Berkeley to commemorate the 25th year of the Southeast Asian diaspora after the war in Southeast Asia (more familiarly known as the Viet Nam War). She asked a few Southeast Asian UC Berkeley students in her class and some she knew to help get involved with the conference. Their role was to head up the youth portion of the co<span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\">nference. Using data information collected the conference Professor Um along with the UC Berkeley students developed the booklet that SASC has called A Dream Denied about Southeast Asians and their struggle to gain access to higher education.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\"><br />After the conference, the youth summit organizers, consisting of members from the Laotian, Hmong, Cambodian, and Vietnamese student groups felt connected and saw a need for a space/coalition to address issues across the community. They recognized that there were distinct groups that already existed to promote cultural awareness and knew that that was not one of their primary goals. They were also aware that they wanted the group to be more than just a student organization, but a coalition between the Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Laotian students coming together on common issues to strengthen the community as a whole, hence the name Southeast Asian Student Coalition. The name was created by the students as they sat at Sproul Fountain. Their goals at the time included greater promotion of higher education, community building between the different groups, outreaching to the larger community.<br /><br />At the time they believed that there was a niche that needed to be filled &ndash; an organization that would work with the different cultural groups as well as the recruitment and retention center to address the SEA community in particular. Their goal was to both build coalition as well as empowerment, and to step beyond the needs at Berkeley to incorporate the communities we came from. They went around the East Bay community asking and understanding what it is exactly that they can do. After all of that, in 2002 SASC Summer Institute was born. They wanted something where they can effectively outreach, teach, and learn to/from young people.<br /><br />Since then SASC has grown into a larger community and has expanded its reaches into the community. SASC&rsquo;s current programs include SEA Grad, SEAMentorship, and SEA Prison Outreach Project.<br /><br />In 2005, a group of SASC folks had multiple meetings about the rebuilding of SASC, due to issues of sustainability and finding leaders in the community. From these meetings SASCommunity, a non-hierarchical committee, was created. SASComm strives to create a community of committees hoping to explore SASC&rsquo;s mission statement in different and multiple dimensions. The Round-Table structure for SASCommunity is set up to create a cohesive unit and non-hierarchical organizing system.</span></p>",

Working toward this dream, SEB has launched UC Berkeley's first two liquid fuelled rockets, Eureka 1 and 2, setting records for Berkeley's highest liquid-fulled rocket launches. We've also launched 10 test-bed rockets and gained a wide array of technical knowledge and skill in rocket subsystems such as composite airframe manufacturing, in-flight data acquisition, and propulsion. Along the way, we've successfully demonstrated thrust vector control, and throttling capabilities too!</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Aside from the rocket projects, SEB takes pride in our inclusive, diverse, and friendly team culture. SEB is one of the few student organizations on campus that maintains open admission policies for interested students. This involves not screening students by resumes, majors, or specific engineering-related experiences. SEB firmly believes that these elements are not as important to becoming a contributing member of the team as pure commitment and willingness to learn new skills and have fun! The team&rsquo;s pattern of also mentoring newcomers and turning them into team veterans helps to keep the organization constantly growing as a rocket team and close friends!</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Find out more on our website, berkeleyse.org, or contact us at spaceenterpriseatberkeley@gmail.com with questions or comments!</p>",

We are dedicated to working within our campus and local community to put an end to abortion, embryonic stem cell research, and euthanasia.</p>\r\n<p>Since BSL is based at a prestigious educational institution, we see the need to educate our community about the truths surrounding offenses against human life. To that end, we facilitate and engage in intellectual discussion on relevant issues, challenging widely held relativist assumptions on the dignity of human life, the role of individual autonomy, and society's role in protecting human life.</p>\r\n<p>We seek to engage both the minds and hearts of UC Berkeley's student population as well as those of our surrounding communities in addressing these issues. We desire to change the prevailing mindset in today's society so that it might be more receptive to a culture of life that fully recognizes the dignity of every human being.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, we aim to form leaders that will encourage the development of a more just society grounded in the recognition of the inherent and transcendent value of human life. We seek to enter our respective professions armed with the knowledge and tools needed to uphold the dignity of life in every facet of society.</p>\r\n<p>Also at the heart of BSL&rsquo;s mission is its commitment to community service. We believe that socioeconomic circumstances do not justify the taking of human life, and we affirm that such difficulties can be overcome. To that end, BSL provides information to assist women facing crisis pregnancies and refers them to local crisis pregnancy centers that provide women with what they need to bring new life into the world. We also volunteer at local crisis pregnancy centers to help promote their mission to encourage the&nbsp;cherishing and welcoming of&nbsp;new life into our community.</p>\r\n<p>Though the focus of our outreach is primarily local, we collaborate with other pro-life organizations from across our state and nation and are united to them by virtue of our common cause. As a member of Students for Life of America (SFLA), BSL engages in the fight for life at the state and national level. As an organization that concerns itself with matters of great public relevance, BSL strives to do everything in its capacity to shape public opinion on relevant university, state, and federal policies, as well as to influence said policies, so that these might more accurately reflect our vision for a world in which every human life is valued and protected.</p>",

As a campus chapter in Berkeley, we organize reading groups to facilitate academic discussions in philosophy and theology, lectures given by experts in St. Thomas, and social gatherings to provide a fun and comfortable outlet to discussing the complexities of St. Thomas. We also attend intellectual retreats, each focused on a specified topic as it relates to Thomas Aquinas.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Thomistic?</em></p>\r\n<p>St. Thomas Aquinas stands at the heart of what we do. We believe Aquinas' philosophy and theology facilitates great intellectual discussions and debates. With St. Thomas as our touchstone, our speakers and events open endless possibilities for discussion and growth in intellect! Many speakers are experts not only in areas of Thomistic research, but in philosophy, science, literature, theology, and more.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Events</em></p>\r\n<p>There are many different kinds of events a chapter can organize: select a speaker from our network of academics for a lecture, organize a reading group, or even a student retreat or conference!

To further their purpose, they looked to educate others about Vietnamese culture, history, and heritage.</p>\r\n<p>Through their efforts they built a family away from home for Vietnamese and Vietnamese American students, a community that continues to grow.</p>\r\n<h4>Cal VSA Today</h4>\r\n<p>Today, Cal VSA is still a student organization that embraces our Vietnamese and Vietnamese American roots and culture. Though our members are a part of a new generation, we recognize and commemorate the experiences that our parents and relatives have had while also striving to identify and to understand the emerging narratives and current issues in our community.</p>\r\n<p>Cal VSA, alongside our goals, has evolved as an organization but we are still driven by the same principles that our founders embraced. These principles can be summed up by our three pillars:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Academics</strong> | We recognize and embrace the opportunities that we have been given and we endeavor to extend the same opportunities to others in our community.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community</strong> | We recognize the diverse contemporary issues facing our community and we attempt to understand them, to promote awareness about them, and to address them.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Culture</strong> | We recognize that we have a unique Vietnamese heritage and tradition and we aim to preserve and to learn more about our culture.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Though we are an organization that focuses on the Vietnamese American experience, we are honored to be able to count many members of non-Vietnamese heritage as part of our family. <strong>We welcome any and all students to come see what Cal VSA has to offer!</strong></p>",

SFHBC at Berkeley provided trained bilingual students as Asian language interpreters for two monthly UCSF hepatitis B student-run clinics, which we continue to volunteer at.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dedicated to helping stop the spread of Hepatitis B, SFHBC partnered with organizations such as the San Francisco Hepatitis B Free Campaign and helped at various screening, vaccination, and education events. Four hundred million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B infection, which tragically can lead to liver cancer early in adult life. It is the 10th leading etiologic cause of death in the world. Fortunately, the spread of the hepatitis B virus is preventable with a simple, safe, and effective vaccine.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Due to an increase in demand for interpretation services, we have been expanding to provide interpretation and volunteering services for a broader range of issues beyond hepatitis B. In August 2010, SFHBC at Berkeley was renamed the Volunteer Health Interpreters Organization (VHIO) to reflect its expanded scope of language capacities and its service base across the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We provide trained volunteer interpreters in several languages - Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Hindi-Urdu, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese - from UC Berkeley to healthcare organizations and facilities for underserved LEP communities. We work closely with UCSF medical and pharmacy students, UOP dental students, health workers, and medical providers to serve patients and help them overcome the language barrier in healthcare.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VHIO plays an integral role in our community by outreaching to the underserved immigrant neighborhoods and assisting them at individual medical appointments and health fairs.

Our vision of socialism is profoundly feminist, anti-racist, and anti-imperialist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/cal-ydsa/shared_invite/zt-222w2ekfk-Rmxv3pg80bLe~2fRGstmyg\">JOIN OUR SLACK CHANNEL</a> TO GET INVOLVED!

    "Description": "<p><strong>Welcome to Zeta Tau Alpha, Upsilon Chapter at UC Berkeley!</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are members of the Panhellenic Community at Cal, which is comprised of 12 national organizations and one local chapter. At ZTA, we are passionate about empowering each and every sister to reach her full potential, both at this university and beyond. One of the lines in our creed is \"<em>to realize that within our grasp lies the opportunity to learn those things which will ever enrich and ennoble our lives</em>.\" Our sisters live this out each and every day; we are passionate about our philanthropy, Breast Cancer Education and Awareness, which our chapter recently received a&nbsp;<em>Founders Award</em>&nbsp;for raising $10,000+ in the last 3 years! Our partnerships with Bright Pink and the American Cancer Society have also led us to pass out thousands of pink ribbons at the Think Pink Cal Football Game, volunteer at the survivor booth for <em>Making Strides</em>, and put on exciting events for the Greek community such as Sugarfest and Cookout for a Cure.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even more, we maintain a sisterhood that lasts a lifetime; Zetas can be found in so many organizations, be it dance, pre-professional organizations, consulting, STEM labs, or even the ASUC! The friendships formed at ZTA will follow you through your entire collegiate experience, from football gamedays with your sisters to weekends in San Fransisco or Lake Tahoe. The mentorship from older members, both in academics and in life, will be invaluable as you navigate a campus of 40,000 students, and will shape the way you see the world around you. ZTA also offers over 30 leadership positions and multiple committees within the chapter, which allow you to develop your strengths and give back!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Last but not least, you'll always have a home at 2714 Durant Avenue; from Friday brunches to Bachelor Mondays, our sorority is undoubtedly a home away from home :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Zeta Tau Alpha participates in Fall Formal Recruitment as well as continuous open bidding (COB) at the beginning of each semester, so if you are interested in joining our organization, visit our website or email our vice president of membership at ztacalmembership@gmail.com.
