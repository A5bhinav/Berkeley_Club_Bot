Diversatech at Berkeley is the worst one,137
Bro there is asian monoculture at the school lol,178
"Interesting take and valid points, but i think the primary cause of the race monolith is that they love to let in their friends; and those friends tend to be of the same racial background, due to family connections or other random reasons.",150
for the pbl one they have basically a DEI statement on their website and from what I see not a single urm ( black or brown person) is in the club lol. these people don't practice what they preach . the hypocrisy.,62
sucks but it’s how it be sometimes - you can make the first step and create your own. but in the long run you’re not missing too much from extremely exclusive clubs,66
"Let’s not forget they’re always from competitive Bay Area, Los Angeles, or Orange County high schools with majority Asian populations!",10
"Just like in the real world: Without some kind of mandate (e.g. a DEI initiative or an affirmative action* requirement) people like to hire people that are just like them.  We used to refer to it as it “the old boys club.”  

*Affirmative action was banned in CA 30 years ago, not recently like many people believe.",7
This school is very much Asian dominated to a point that you will get excluded from certain groups if you arent,15
"I am sure there are minority students who don't even bother applying because of how homogeneous the clubs look. Also, all these clubs having a token white boy for diversity lol",9
"As a Black student and a member of one of these consulting clubs at Cal, I am interested in learning more about the pool of applicants to these clubs receive. The demographics of their applicants should be publicly released. There would be support from other students if we raised this issue on a larger platform. 

I have not experienced racism in the club I am a member of yet, but I can see how it would be difficult for students from historically underserved backgrounds to gain access. Instead, I would argue these clubs are more classist than racist. Most of the students in these clubs come from privileged backgrounds. They work very hard for a lot of the accomplishments under their belt, but a lot have had access to tremendous resources.

Regardless, classism is the cousin of racism, and the way these clubs recruit produce discriminatory outcomes.  I mean, some of these clubs don't even have a lot of white students. Some of the white org's are more diverse.  

Are these clubs as meritocratic as they market themselves to be? Not sure.",4
"**Nepotism**: *the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives, friends, or associates, especially by giving them jobs.*",14
"Well, not entirely.  Top one looks almost half non-(East) Asian. Middle one a bit less. Bottom one very East Asian, though not exclusively (5/7 execs).

> Likewise, the majority of consulting club applicants are asian, but there's a very VERY noticable monolothic type of member that gets accepted.

Are acceptance rates actually skewed though? I'm not seeing evidence of discrimination here.  As you note, East and South Asians presumably are way more likely to apply. 

> Overall my takeaway is if you're a minority don't bother wasting your time and applying to these clubs.

Seems like a harsh conclusion to take without any numbers. Again the top one looks reasonably diverse.",33
OK Asians are 1 monolithic culture we get it.,41
How did I graduate without knowing anything about these clubs 😂,3
lol wait until you find out about greek life,8
"There's no consulting clubs with Black leadership? If not, I'd strongly advise you to form one. You'll get buy in and support from all the big tech companies. Big tech is very inclusive. But the lack of Black and Hispanic engineers is a huge gap that the country needs to address. You making this post shows you've got some of the fire needed to make this happen.",7

"Clubs are the same in college as before in high school. Popularity based on cliques. They vote for each other for student government and on yearbook popularity surveys (best smile, best dressed, most athletic, most funny, etc). They going be gatekeeping who they want in their clubs. I don’t even bother as I don’t even care. And as in high school, I have my own closed net of friends.",1
"sorry to say this but asians on average are just more accomplished on any objective merit-based scale. This is evident in literally everything aside from sports. You can say its due to socioeconomic background or whatever. But it's a fact that on paper, Asians are better. Any educated person would agree to this, including minorities and whites. Let me be clear, I'm not making any inherent attachments to race and the merit of an application. I'm just saying that statistically there are more Asians with better GPA, Resumes, test scores, internships etc. There's no point ignoring that.

The real world isn't your college apps. Yes, social connections matter but so does the resume screen as well as how you literally perform during the interviews. You can't expect a Holistic assessment of a club recruitment process buddy.

Another reality check for you, everyone in STEM is fucking asian in this school. I'm an international and I've been in the US for 3 years now. To this fucking day, I still cannot come to terms with the fact that I came to America and see more 100x East/South Asian people than I do white/hispanic/black people. You can walk into any STEM class and WHITE people are the minority and most of the time there isn't even >1 black person... Asian people dominate this school - SHOCKER! The people who get recruited for these clubs are mostly STEM & Business majors who are mostly, you guessed it ... ASIAN.

These consulting clubs have < 5% acceptance rate. I've never once seen a black person during any of my club interviews. I'm sure they're out there and there are black/white/Hispanic people who do apply but the number of people applying who are asian is so much higher so it's no surprise that the people that get in are mostly Asian. A lot of these clubs also literally ask applicants to remove their name and identifying information from their resumes too.

Like no shit everyone's Asian. I'm not saying nepotism doesn't exist. It absolutely does and is really bad. But tying Race to this type of nepotism is the most amount of copium anyone can take. From any objective viewpoint, there is no statistical necessity for the number of non-Asians to be anywhere equal to the number of Asians in these clubs. Unless you're asking these clubs to employ some sort of diversity hire / affirmative action policies which is honestly just more insulting to minorities at this school.

Like I said, nepotism definitely exists here. But I highly doubt that anyone is actively trying to recruit their friends only of a specific race. There is neither a subconscious nor conscious desire to make an asian monolithic culture in these clubs. Its just a fact that there's an undoubtedly high statistical likelihood that these clubs will get dominated by Asians.

It's just pure copium to say its because of race. You applied to 10 clubs and only made the interviews for 2 and didn't get past the first round for either. Now go and take a look at the number of asians who applied and did the same if not worse than you. I know several asians who applied to 10+ clubs and didn't make the first round for any. I also know many who applied to 10+ clubs and didn't even get into one at the end. It just so happens that competitive processes tend to be competitive ...",-19

"this sounds callous but I legitimately feel as though there will be nothing else more beneficial for you in this career field, lose weight and glow up.

Superficial appearance factors and general sociability seriously has more weight to your application. Of course, once you made the resume screen, your foot is essentially in the door. Now you have to just make sure you pass the case-test which is honestly not that hard.

1. practice case work and say out your answer ALOUD
2. lose weight and look presentable

"As someone in a consulting club, I'd say there are three main factors: background, skills, and fit.  Some of these factors influence the seeming monoculture of consulting types that draws so much criticism, but I'm just sharing what I know (not everything that's wrong with the system).

  
Background: Every consulting club at Berkeley asks for a resume at the start of the application process, with your stats and accomplishments spelled out.  This is where someone on their executive board can see whether or not you did X science fair, had Y award, or did Z for your community.  No real way to improve this beyond the obvious, it's luck that someone in the exec views the accomplishment as 'prestigious' or did the same thing.  Best way to succeed here is min/max your high school stats.

  
Skills: After the resume round, the next step is a case interview/product interview/product challenge.  This tests your skills at the type of consulting the club conducts, and there are a few important things that go into that.  The way you present yourself, the solutions you find, and unexpectedly, the way you ask questions.  In casing, you can definitely ask right/wrong questions, so be sure to ask what gives you the most useful info during your interview.  Best way to succeed here is to run casing interviews with people you know, or ChatGPT (which I did).

  
Fit: The most subjective and controversial portion of consulting interviews.  This factor is controlled by the way you act, and can be helped if you coffee chat someone, present yourself in a unique (but not annoying/weird) way, or have a personal connection in the club.  Consulting club executive boards need an opinion on you to vouch for you, so making sure you can be remembered is important.

  
That being said, consulting is realistically difficult but not impossible to get into without the connections that so many people talk down on it for.  Without connections, I made it to the final round of a top consulting club before choosing another one and turning them down.  If you want to get in, it's basically college apps; throw your hat in the ring and see where it lands.",2

"advice so it doesn't feel earth shattering: clubs should be fun, not stressful. Things like this usually happen because better things are in store for you, or there are better ways you could be spending your time. Maybe it's time to revisit an old hobby or pick up a new one. Something that no one can tell you, you can't do that or you can't be apart of this, Like an instrument, skateboarding, or painting. This setback does not define you, and you deserve better. I believe life will give you something far better and more fulfilling.  Keep your focus on yourself, your health, and your wealth. Carry on.",121
"your life is over. these club decisions directly determine your first job, all subsequent jobs, your future net worth, your chances of ever finding love, and your value as a human being.

"Alumni bear here. Never knew about consulting when in undergrad. Was MCB and Public Health. 

Learned later in grad school what it was, how consulting works, and made it through multiple case interviews at Deloitte, McKinsey, BCG, and boutique firms. 

Then realized I could leverage my network, didn’t really want to work for someone else and started my own firm before I was 30 (focus on organizational design and change management) and cleared mid six figures running things the way I want (no all-nighters for stupid PowerPoint decks that don’t go anywhere, rolling up my sleeves and working across all levels of the organization from frontline staff to being the EC for the csuite, etc)

Point being, when I was an undergrad, I heard my friends freak out about Haas and consulting club interviews. I promise it will mean so little in the future, and honestly now that I do know about it, find it so infuriating how elitist this is. Find alumni who work at the companies you’re interested in and reach out. You just need one to believe in you and be willing to mentor/sponsor you. Don’t let this club hold you back. Opportunities are made, no point in fighting with everyone else for the same ones.",85

"I will write a post about my experience with clubs on a post soon to share my view and perspective. But as a person who’s run successful businesses, is friends with tech CEO’s, and top executives I can tell you there is nothing these clubs can offer you that you can’t find on your own. In fact, doing it on your own will make you a better candidate in my opinion for a lot of jobs. No hiring manager is holding slots for people just because they were in a club and having “connections” doesn’t exist unless the person you know is a top level executive. Take this opportunity to lock in and surpass these people, because at the end of the day these aren’t your friends they are your competition for jobs. You have been around them long enough to know their strengths and weaknesses so now use that to your advantage and adapt!",12
"gave up on consulting clubs they beg for useless projects from big companies to show off the logos 😭 they just do a whole bunch of bullshit and be intimidating about it 😁 anyone can be a consultant it’s just solving other peoples and company problems so just go about life and develop your interests, i swear 9/10 times you can consult for any major (literally even an art consultant for a building or residential place or whatever) 

this is getting a bit personal cause i was caught up in applying to consulting clubs too but biz majors have classes like “leading people” bffr you don’t need to learn that at a school rather be taking sociology or psychology and get the same effect i promise you they all just leverage the network later on with the club alumni

there are so many other clubs on campus that are much more welcoming and not elitist where you can contribute to actual causes and interests you care about over resume workshopping and making a slide deck the company doesn’t even care about :)",7

"alumni bear here i graduated this past may: don’t worry about it trust me. during my undergrad i realized a lot of consulting clubs at berkeley have a very cult like personality and they pick and choose at their own will. there is no logic behind it and the faster you understand that, the happier you are going to be. 

when i was a junior i applied to a club (i was already president of another club not consulting) but my friends wanted me to do it for fun, after the first interview i didn’t get in and i felt like a loser. fast forward to summer i got this internship and job at a good brand and that following fall that SAME club and another consulting club reached out to me begging me to partner with them. what i did was i decided to join the other club for fun and they didn’t even accept me 🤣 even though they were begging to partner and consult for my brand and asking me to be the middle man? (also my company did not give a shit about their consulting projects because we were actually focused on making revenue and not wasting time) after rejecting me, they still didn’t leave me for over a year😭 they would constantly ask me on linkedin and send me emails asking for partnering opportunities. this just goes on to show how desperate and pathetic sometimes they are. i was literally working for a brand already that they were BEGGING to partner with and they didn’t want to be around a person like me whom they might get jealous of because stating facts, I was already doing what they wanted to do in their future. im sharing my story because its super funny to me how consulting clubs on campus seem like an important factor in your career when they aren’t. be true to yourself, join clubs that resonate with your passion, do side projects, companies care more about that. heck yeah even cold email companies asking for project opportunities as an undergrad. this is a blessing in disguise and now you can stay away from these clubs and actually focus on your own life and career because tbh those clubs don’t do much but suck your soul. if you ever need advice, im happy to help!",5

"I was flabbergasted to learn joining a club at Cal has become so competitive.  As an alumni who does a good amount of hiring let me tell you this …. these clubs have a minuscule (or zero) impact on you getting a job.  Yes it looks good to have a well rounded resume, but that can easily be done with volunteering with an organization that may or may not be associated with Cal.  There is so much need in the East Bay.  People need help with all sorts of things … help school kids with math or science, volunteer at a homeless shelter, volunteer at the SPCA, get involved at a local environmental group.  Help organize events.  Look for opportunities to lead an initiative with these organizations.

Honestly Cal was MUCH BETTER when we had affirmative action.  Kids today at Cal are too round up.  It’s not good to have everyone on the same mind set of achieve-achieve-achieve!  Slow down.  My god get high and have a few drinks!   Do kids even have fun anymore?!?  Clubs are supposed to be extracurricular activities.  Heck do what my friend did and CREATE your own club.  Looks way better on a resume.

And to go back to my original point, all your extracurriculars barely get glanced at.  It’s sort of a high/medium/low assessment.   I see this person went to Cal (most notable), they have a degree in X (second most notable), and I see a medium amount of words under activities (least important).  

Then of course when you get “real” experience the entire education section of your resumes gets demoted in importance even further.  Sure the institution and degree still matter but they are more there to round out story of you … “Here is a gal who has 4 years of experience as a Data Scientist at X company, oh BTW and I see she went to Cal, that tracks, and I’ll put her a little higher in a pile of people with similar experience, but she is still lower than those with more relevant experience and career accomplishments.”  At this point your activities associated with Cal become even less important.",0

"Private apartment buildings like The Standard have rooftop decks and lounges and other indoor spaces for the use of residents.  Have your friend who lives there ask the building management for any written policies about reserving lounges and common outdoor spaces for private use. 

Generally, those spaces are supposed to be for the use of all of the residents of the building. I don't know about that building in particular.  

But those types of buildings get their development permits from the City based on their representations of what will be provided in the buildings--and one of the things they often represent is ""useable open space"" for the residents, like rooftop decks, and lounges. 

It's one thing if a resident has a birthday party or something in a lounge--it's another if the lounges / roof decks are being regularly taken away from the majority of the residents for use by outside groups (regardless of whether a member of that group lives in the building.)",19

That must have cost a fortune only to end up looking like something my nephew could've whipped up in MS Paint during snack time. The Enron debacle should've been lesson enough—big names, bigger bills, but where's the value? I guess it boils down to companies loving that external validation even if it means shelling out big bucks for recycled buzzwords and superficial changes.",2

"I mean take my advice with a grain of salt but from what I’ve seen and heard from friends in the consulting community, BC and BBS have fallen off in terms of projects and placements. They have just been riding off their reputation and name but you are better off choosing a consulting club where you genuinely like the community and could see yourself spending four years of your college career with them. Like a lot of people in this community say, consulting clubs are really not that deep and a lot of the overhyped prestigious clubs have a lot of assholes.

That said, a lot of clubs are known to have great communities. I’ve heard great things about ppl in NIB, 180, Venture, TBG, etc. If all you want is the name on your resume, BC is probably still your best bet? But not as good as you think anymore from what I can tell.",5

It’s a win win situation as long as the group you’re with is a good group who learns how to work together and tries to just get experience with networking and learning how to be responsible. 

It’s like anything else in college, it’s a good tool to learn, mature, and to grow.",1

">but i am not into drugs or hazing or anything too crazy

Yea dawg that's almost every damn club on campus ESPECIALLY consulting clubs lmfao 😂 Almost every club social activity has drinking and drugs at their internal events... Welcome to college lol

The sad reality you'll never really ""fit in"" or be ""that guy"" if you're not comfortable with doing any of these things, and that's fine. You can still join the club, do your job, and just not go to the social events. Hazing exists but not nearly as bad as the frats

If you're anywhere from slightly to insanely narcissistic and like flexing staying at 5 star hotels, ""business"" dinners at Michelin restaurants, and racking up a shit ton of miles and status with airlines all on the company's dime after graduating, consulting is perfect for you

Edit: To answer your question, Voyager is full of cocky, narcisstic and egotistical assholes, and if you got in, you're probably one too, so probably not worth mentioning",7

- interviews: basically, don’t be an asshole, we look for behavioral red flags in how you talk and interact with others, and we do actually grade you on your casing (it’s at least 50% of your score) both on getting the right answer and how you approach the problem even if you don’t get it right

"Take this with a grain of salt as when I was there there was no four year program so everyone was applying sophomore year or transfers. I think that does matter as there’s probably way more limited space given an entire new category of students at haas which means things may be more competitive than they were before.

The advice I got was that they want applicants to showcase their four pillars as well as want an applicant to show that they will be successful with or without the program. Essentially, what they want to see is that you’re engaged and have a plan for yourself that you believe the curriculum it has will help you with, not that the name brand of the program will make or break your path. In simple terms would taking an introduction to private equity class actually help you for your own career ambitions, not convince you to go into private equity. Given that at least when I applied, it seemed like the traditional accounting, banking, consulting students didn’t do as well in applications compared to students who did more fun clubs, or unique clubs, but showed leadership potential. Essentially, it seemed like kids who ran the anime club for example and wrote about that experience typically grabbed Application readers more than being a member at Berkeley finance club. People have gotten in with demonstrated interest in a typical business careers, but the typically wrote about it and showcase a particularly unique aspect of that career, for example, wanted to go into environmental consulting or wanting to do investment banking for new tech companies to help grow them versus simply to make money. All this is to say I wouldn’t join a club in particular to apply to the program because that is not a guaranteed thing, but I would join a finance club if you feel like that club‘s actual knowledge And network could improve your life, or that the social connections will be a fun time. I would think of the club choice as an independent decision from the application.

In terms of clubs, Berkeley finance club is the most well known and connected. They do things like pitching a stock, intro to basic financial statements, how to do well in banking interviews, etc. However, in my experience, they have a history of hazing and heavy drinking, so to me if you believe you can gain a lot of that knowledge on your own via your own research then I wouldn’t think it’s worth it, but it is a good one stop shop for all the information you would need. I believe there’s a similar accounting society and a consulting club on campus, but I don’t have much knowledge there.

Instead, I would actually target on doing an internship either while at school or in the summer. If you can land a pretty interesting professional experience that will do much better on your application than a club would, as it shows genuine integration into the workforce.",4
a bunch of ppl in the best consulting/business & tech clubs at berkeley are forming a new club called Business & Software at Berkeley. might be worth checking out if you want to gain some professional/project experience and grow ur network,3
If you're getting a PhD I think your path diverged from consulting clubs a long time ago. They're just an excuse to party and put something on a resume. Hopefully you aren't looking to party with undergrads and I doubt a consulting club would add anything to your resume,6
Yes it’s actually called PhD Consulting Club! I think the email is phdconsultingclub@gmail.com,1
"You can definitely do it and I think it's very much worth trying! I think it's always a good sign if you see that the club has a lot of members who joined as a junior (as a freshman admit or transfer), which you can see during their recruitment events.

There are sooo many consulting clubs that have all different niches and purposes, so you should have a lot of options!

If anything, something I noticed is that people who join clubs as a freshman usually burn out or ""retire"" by the time they hit their junior year (or join another club), so I would almost argue juniors are more likely to be more ""productive"" members of a consulting club.

"I once asked someone who was tabling for a consulting club this exact question. His eyes glazed over as soon as I asked and he was suddenly more interested in flagging down people walking by then talking to me lol. My guess is that they kind of perpetuate themselves. Because there are so many, people keep making more. I think it might also be because these clubs can get little gigs from businesses whereas more ""traditional"" clubs don't have that kind of overlap with the ""real world"". Just my 2c",42
It's funny how they advertise their recruitment but accept few people. Like 🤣🤣. Are you open like the Marine Corps during Vietnam with your advertisement? Or are you like a mini Harvard in exclusivity. To me it doesn't make much sense to advertise yet take very few people.,9

"I am not trying to hate at all, and I suppose this comes from a place of my own ignorance, but I have been trying to understand what exactly consultants “consult” on. Like engineering consulting, financial consulting, image/brand consulting, then OK, those are specific areas of expertise one grows over time, and I get that, but when people basically with no base expertise say that want to get into consulting, I just wonder, what are you going to consult on? What expertise will you have to offer? Or is it just consulting for the sake of consulting? I guess I just don’t get it. Could someone please help me understand? Again, I get I am ignorant on this. Thanks.",7
"Job also involves a lot of traveling that can be expensed through the company. Some friends built up a lot of mileage points and then went on trips.

For noobs, in case you don't know being able to present is 75% of professionalism. Speaking of decks, they know what one is, can make one, tear it down and re-build it better. I can leave them with the client for a moment and not worry about losing the account or heaven forbid, them asking the client for a job.

It’s much more hurtful to make a face and rudely reject someone who is being asked most likely by an officer to do this or are an officer themselves in charge of a club. Usually a person might have less control over whether they really want to hand out flyers or not and are just trying to promote their club to be a part of the team. The person handing out the flyer themselves most likely knows that it can be a little annoying to people so they mainly reach out to people who appear more open, walk closer, and are making eye contact with them.

data/tech consulting:
- any club with data in their name (data good, data story, idk the rest but chances are they all do the same thing
- valley consulting (one of the more “upper tier” clubs, can be hard to get into
- upsync consulting

product/design:
- berkeley innod 
- productspace 
- any club with innovation/design in their name

nonprofit/social impact:
- grc (global research & consulting)
- 180 degrees consulting
- the berkeley group (TBG)

if you’re also interested in finance: 
- microfinance at berkeley (they consult for small companies i believe)

healthcare-specific:
- hcg (healthcare consulting group)
- phoenix

entertainment/media: 
- BCEC

general consulting:
- for these, honestly they all do the same thing. i would say personally just go to infosessions for anyone that you’re interested in, talk to the people and just get a gauge on vibe so you can narrow down your options
- you can do like a mass apply (10+ clubs) but lowkey it’s rlly not that worth it, its a waste of your time, and these clubs talk to each other anyways so they all know what you’re applying to
- focus on making yourself stand out in coffee chats, interviews, and everything else as that’s really the code in my opinion to getting into these clubs
- if you’re rejected, it’s not that big of a deal either! at the end of the day they’re also just students lol and they honestly have no say in how your future trajectory is going to follow anyways so don’t take anything too personally",3

1. That salary is actually very easy to accomplish considering bonus too. In IB, base has risen to 100k out of college, with bonus ranging from 40%-90% of salary depending on bank, year, and personal performance. I have seen people 2 years out of college make $200k all in or more. I say this as if your loan payment schedule only needs about 90k a year, that opens you up to a lot of different career choices outside of just IB or consulting. FP&A is often a lower stress role and safer, and is much easier to get into. People often start at 80-85k, and at larger firms into the 90s. The point is especially in the Bay starting salaries for most financial jobs will hit this mark, so really calculate the minimum needed for the loan to be sustainable. The median starting salary out of Haas for all jobs is 90k ([https://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad/the-value-of-a-haas-degree/careers/](https://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad/the-value-of-a-haas-degree/careers/)). From a pure money standpoint, its much more common for folks to directly go into PE as an analyst and that can have carry from deals, essentially allowing your earning potential to expand rapidly. 
2. IB / Consulting are very competitive, but thats often only because out of Cal (Econ and Haas) people really are only targeting tech investment banking roles in the Bay or in the case of consulting either here or in NY. There are plenty of boutique M&A shops across the country that would love a Cal grad, so long as you are willing to relocate or start your career in a less-desirable specialization (say, industrials M&A or moving to Kansas). There is interesting data from Haas and econ about where people end up going, and its 83% stay in California for Haas from last year's class. [https://career.berkeley.edu/start-exploring/where-do-cal-grads-go/](https://career.berkeley.edu/start-exploring/where-do-cal-grads-go/). 
3. On the loan, the big issue I have with this is that **TONS** of people think like you do and think they can handle IB, and in reality its a 70-90 hour a week job with very few weekends off, constantly being pinged by management and all suffering is deemed ""part of the job"" due to high pay. Many, including myself, started IB thinking I would be in it for the long haul only to discover its one of the most shallow, money focused industries and those who thrive either love money so much that they are willing to sacrifice their lives for it or have vices so expensive they need to pay for it. No joke, many talk about the ""analyst 25"" which is analysts gaining 25 pounds of weight due to lack of exercise and poor eating habits, and the industry has a suicide problem. I say all of this in that you dont want to get a loan thinking you have plenty of money to pay it off in IB or consulting and you are forced to make a choice 2-3 years down the line between your financial safety and your mental health. Its common for analysts to quit after 2 years, not because they planned it but because the industry weeds so many out. I would say if you can get the loan down to where just having a normal job can help pay it off it would allow more freedom for you, so maybe pick up a part-time job while in college, or just space out your college so you dont have to take one. Another way is to start investing, as many jobs would actually like this experience and you may be able to pay for it yourself.

Always happy to answer more specific questions in the DMs.",14
"near impossible to predict and I wouldn't take out loans on that kind of projection. You could graduate in a good or shitty job market year.  That starting salary is not unreasonable - you might also find you have to take a entry level job with a big huge back at 55k,.  You just don't know.",9
I wouldn’t bank on it but it’s very doable in my opinion.,6
"Haas undergrad ‘21 here.

Yes, it is possible. 100k comp is standard especially if you are pursuing those roles.

However, it’s heavily contingent on if you stay in that role long enough to pay the loans off. Consulting, especially IB, have very brutal hours.

There are plenty of boutique IB firms that also pay $100k+. So broaden your search. Also consider business roles in tech, which I ended up in. The WLB is very nice and the pay is solid for fresh out of undergrad.

I would first consider the loan size + interest and then project the monthly payments out based on the expected salary and payment timeline. As an example, I would suggest aiming to pay off a 40k loan within a year - which is very doable if you’re aggressive and understand the exact amount you need to pay on a $100k+ comp.

Or you can be a degenerate like me and take out a $25k student loan during Covid at a 0% interest, buy long dated options contracts on Costco, hold and pray, then sell enough to cover the loan balance and let the rest ride.",3

"The clubs first priority is obviously to do work but it’s also to be a fun group. As a senior, you’re only going to be there for two semesters. You won’t be there that long and will most likely forget about them after a year. I’d suggest just finding part time work to do during the year rather than getting into the club

To answer your question though, you probably won’t have a shot of getting in. There aren’t that many that get in as juniors let alone senior transfers. They may not explicitly be biased intentionally but there’s just little benefit to both parties here",1

"All throughout his speech, he kept saying “I’m probably gonna get in trouble for this”, or words to that effect. And yet, there are comments here saying that being pro-Palestine is the status quo, and that taking a pro-Israel stance is somehow “braver”??? 

If there truly is an unbiased debate, why is one side unapologetic in their views, while the other side constantly feels the need to be conciliatory?",15
"Why is everyone acting like it’s some brave position to be anti-Israel at Berkeley?

The overwhelming majority of students and faculty at Cal have been vehemently pro-Palestine…to the point that many (I know not all) have condoned or dismissed Hamas’ massacre.

Giving a speech in favor of Israel would have been an objectively braver position given the overwhelmingly anti-Zionist sentiments on campus.

Also, having listened to this speech, it’s very clear that this lecturer knows very, very little about the I/P conflict. Did anyone learn anything from this? He’s just speaking in platitudes and issuing vague statements related to “ethnic cleansing” and “genocide.” 

I know many of you don’t want to admit this, but the I/P conflict is extremely nuanced and complicated. Extremist elements on both sides (namely the illegal settlers and their far-right supporters for Israel and Islamist terror groups like Hamas and PIJ in Palestine) are standing in the way of any reconciliation talks.

There’s no easy solution to this. It will take uprooting extremist factions on both sides to take a step forward (that means Netanyahu and his coalition in addition to Hamas…which necessitates a war against Hamas).",64
What a evil creature.,2
"For me there are two types of disagreements. The first is just a basic disagreement where I have a different opinion, but I can understand why someone would think differently thus it is not like I consider the other opinion ""invalid."" Assuming the other person feels the same way about my views (which is rare nowadays tbh), we can theoretically have a healthy conversation about whatever the topic is. A lot of this falls into that first category.

But then, there are other disagreements where I cannot possibly see how someone could ever think/say something like what they did, and it makes me lose respect for the individual making the claim. This falls into that second category:

> But I also do want to remind you all that the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back. That's not how it works. You don't just say, ""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?

So an organization/country that gets attacked has no right to respond? How does that work? Would Peyrin like to have Hamas continue to bomb Israel with no repercussions? Makes no sense!",17
So a bunch of rehashed social media points from someone who barely knew what Israel and Palestine a month ago.,10
"The October 6 attack by Hamas killed 1500 people. Israel has a population of about 10 million.

The equivalent of an attack on the United States with a population of about 320 million would be if about 48,000 people were killed in one day.

The question is, what would you want done if say, a white nationalist group executed an attack like that on the U.S., and said they wanted to do it again, and again, and again. Sure you would want to do something. Would you still do something if somebody then claimed that you were engaging in a genocide on the white supremacists? 

>the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back

This professor believes that nothing should be done.",7
I’m so proud of him! This is so well said.,7
"""""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?""

That is actually exactly how that works...

Yea, this is a political stance. ""underfunding"" according to what ? Tying in the success of an EECS student to taking a stance on Israel or Palestine is indoctrination. He should be disciplined for this.

"Please do not refer to Berkeley as ""UCB.""

PSA to UCSD students from the Berkeley community

Recently a meme was shared to our subeddit outlining a dismissive and disrespectful act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of.

Please do not refer to Berkeley as ""UCB."" This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. Cal, Berkeley or UC Berkeley are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. UCB, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that ""UCB"" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""UCB"" to refer our school. Thank you.

TL:DR

Don't say ""UCB"" when referring to Berkeley.",24

Overall general tip: be a contrarian. Think outside the box.

My personal quote: “If you do what everyone else is doing, by definition, your expected outcome will be average. And another word for average is mediocre.”

Grinding leetcode is a race to the bottom. Software engineering is a global workforce, and there are people just as smart or smarter around the world, wiling to work even harder than you, for less pay. Work on projects over long periods of time, to demonstrate passion and grit, not just a workhorse. Develop a unique skillset or experience that sets you apart from the rest.

You can grind gigs on Craigslist. I did that when I was early days out of college, even when I was employed—this increased my earning rate and learning/experience rate by at least 2-3x compared to my peers.

Learn to use AI and LLMs. Find gigs which can be automated, and optimize (min/max) ROI. It seems laughable on the surface, but if you can find opportunities to make $1 or $20 repeatedly, with minimal time and effort, and do this with enough frequency and volume, you can make more money than you ever will working a 9-5.

Learn business acumen. Watch YouTube for topics that will amplify your impact as SWE. Learn business and entrepreneurship.

Discipline your mind and body. Exercise regularly. Read books to level up—books are awesome—for merely $20 bucks, you can download someone’s life’s work or decades of experience, distilled into liquid gold, and absorb in a matter of hours or days, like Neo from the Matrix. I recommend Contrarian MBA: https://contrarian.mba

Pick up a hobby. Get a social group of friends. Life is too short to focus and obsess merely on one thing.

The Navy SEALs have a saying: when you’re feeling tired and exhausted, your body is actually only 40% expended. Keep pushing through and forward.

Another approach: offer to work for someone extremely influential or accomplished, that you can realistically reach within your network or 1, 2nd, 3rd degree connections, for free. Set expectations that is for a limited scope or time, and knock it out of the park. Ask them to promise a referral if they are satisfied with your work. This will typically catapult you forward by at least 5 years, if not a decade or more, of progress.

"It's brutal out there. I've been in the tech industry for a while now - it's not your fault. There's nothing wrong with you. There's nothing you did wrong. The economy and market have changed so rapidly and it sucks that you got the short end of the stick.

So many tech companies have slashed or outright eliminated their jr swe roles. Some companies think jr engineers can be completely replaced by AI. A good chunk of hiring managers have been burned by new grad hires - they hire a jr engineer only to discover they've been completely reliant on chatgpt for the past 4 years and are unable to code. 

Be careful with recruiting firms and headhunters - the majority of them will only waste your time and some are outright scams. 

You could try applying to internships and let companies know you're okay with a 3-4 month gig. Some companies are open to hiring new grads as interns. 

My biggest piece of advice is when you apply for jobs, sort by the newest. A jr engineering role will get 1k applications within a couple of days. You want to be as high on the list as possible.",5

Considering going to Cal for their graduate programs as I had my undergrad in CS out of state, but if theres any reassurance in this, one of my friends in the bay went to UCSC and wasn't able to get a CS degree because of not being able to retake a semester (had to fly back home for her father's funeral). As unfair as it was, she continued on with a degree in Network and Digital Tech, and after a year and a half of job hunting, she landed a SWE role at Meta. There's no telling how long it'll take, but it only takes one to stick.

As others have suggested, low level management at Starbucks, Peets, Wholefoods, Amazon, or the like.  The jobs usually come with medical (for you not your partner), and pay enough for a cheap apartment and a ""beater"" car.

"You may want to consider making an appointment with a substance use disorder (SUD)/addiction counselor. Your first thoughts may be that you aren't looking to completely stop using substances and/or you're not an addict, but neither of those things would disqualify you from SUD counseling. SUD counselors are trained to speak with anyone about substance use, even if it's just someone looking for more information. A competent SUD counselor will be knowledgeable about harm reduction and can work with you on responsible ways to manage your usage. If you feel pressured to immediately quit using substances, that's a failure by the counselor, not you. The primary role of a SUD counselor is to inform and support the client in making their own choices about their recovery, whether that is harm reduction or complete abstinence. Many SUD counselors have lived experience with substance use, so you may want to look specifically for someone with that experience if you think it would make you feel more comfortable.

You may also want to look into taking a course about addiction/substances at a community college. My Addiction Studies courses were taken out of state, so I don't know what's available locally, but it can provide a lot of clear information about what various substances are, how they act in your body, and what risks are associated with them.

Obviously having a big company name is definitely a huge plus when recruiting but at the end of the day it’s your contributions that a company will be looking for; from a recruiters POV it’s probably better you did meaningful work at a startup than some sandboxed busywork type of a project at a big company 

At the end of the day, it’s your own skill and abilities that matters most, so it’s the experience that counts IMHO

"They do nothing useful. Just learn how to talk and make slides. But the consulting career is like that in any case (soft skills, politics, making spreadsheets for laying off people) so it is good prep and you’ll be able to network with club alumni if you want to go into consulting for a career.",4

"As someone who’s been in one of the “big” consulting clubs back when I was in undergrad, just know by Senior year, I had so much stuff on my resume from doing research projects, internships, and other work (all which weren’t related in any way or form to consulting clubs) that I just omitted all the projects I did for the club. It was nice making a cool friend group while working on deliverables but you can literally make friends doing stuff for other clubs as well. 

Seriously consider research under professors. While consulting clubs are kissing ass to do a single presentation for Microsoft (with a solution rarely ever gets used), you can be getting your name on a research paper that Microsoft will actually read and apply to their business. Other pros are you can get paid or get units.

Also, like others said, you can put your heart and soul into the apps and interviews, it’s wasted effort. We spend like 5 seconds on each app and pick whoever we know or is cool (sometimes attractive 😬). It’s a like-ability interview, not a professional interview.",39
"You're overestimating the opportunities you think you'll have in a consulting club. Trust me, no one with any money gives a damn what a bunch of college kids think about their field or buisness. The best thing you can do is excel in your field of study and gain expertise. If you want to get into consulting later, your credentials are going to be a lot more important than being in some random student club. Additionally, if you are serious, try to do a Summer internship or something with a firm you're interested in.",45
i’m just sorry that you’ve fallen into the false notion of finance clubs having any actual prestige beyond that of a high-school level popularity angst,22
"They're a waste of time, unless you're just in it for the social aspect (which, if you're trying to make friends, there are much better groups to join). Spend the hours you'd spend on useless club bullshit on getting some work and research experience under your belt. A good resume won't even have room on it for club achievements, because it should already be absolutely full of work, research, fellowships, volunteer experience, and academic achievements.",26
"I got rejected from like 8 clubs my first semester and the same amt the next semester, mostly all consulting clubs. Then got rejected from all but 1 club the semester after. It was frustrating. It was hard.

Best thing I did was join a non consulting club who accepted me for who I was and the prior experience I had (resume was terrible)... the only reason to really join a club is for social life/culture/meeting ppl and you can get that in many different places so don't feel bad. Joining a consulting club doesn't define you and shouldn't be overglorified. People advertise the fun stuff but it's a lot of grunt work (I've been in a intercollegiate consulting club for a semester and left right away). And don't just gun for super popular ones, broaden your scope and look for clubs that are less exclusive or that you find interesting/fun.

Not saying consulting clubs are bad, it's just not necessary.",7
"hey i get what you mean, and you're gonna be fine! if im being honest, consulting clubs are kinda the butt of a lot of jokes for good reason — many do good work, but some perpetuate this culture of exclusive access/benefit even though you can get the same skills/experiences from independent projects, research, etc! also lol i had a group interview for a consulting club earlier today and the other students interviewing were.... not rly the type of people i'd want to work with so it's kind of a mixed bag. it's unavoidable but stupid that students are placed in the position to judge other students and it's all so arbitrary considering that esp during the spring they only take a handful of people. you're not doing anything wrong at all, it's a ridiculous process :/ doing well in classes and seeking out experience through research, teaching, internships, side projects etc will net you the same personal gains, and there's lots of other communities on campus that provide groups of friends without the exclusivity culture :)",8

"""stepping stone"" is crazy 💀",6
"They provide them with under-compensated worker drones and potential future fresh blood to be exploited in junior positions post-graduation.

The most useful thing they could offer are the friendships and networks built. I've noticed that various clubs on campus compete for people's free time, so it can sometimes be challenging to make strong friendships outside of these kind of circles. 
Whether this is worth it or not also depends on your field of study and goals.",16
"Cal Alumni here who is currently working at a Big 4 consulting firm (and now involved in recruitment for said firm at Cal)

You’ll be part of a summer buddy system where we give you tailored advice at the different stages of the recruitment process and it goes a long way in your odds of getting an offer.",2

If anything, do what u/Junkin7 is doing and start your own club! Most of these selective clubs you guys complain about had humble beginnings, with a small community and no one trying to join. They're selective today because of the success they have found and the growth they've been through.

"As someone fairly familiar with the business club community at Berkeley, I’ll try to give an honest take on the different clubs you’ve mentioned:  
BC -  BC is the oldest and arguably the most established consulting club at Berkeley. They usually get a pretty good range of clients and quality of their work is arguably the best, in addition to their professional development.  
Voyager - I hear a lot about Voyager mostly from their members who always seem to be talking about their social culture. They seem to be very tight knit as a group and have a lot of fun but also seem to net a range of big-name projects each semester. Placement also seems solid.  
CBA - CBA is actually AKPsi rebranded (they were called the Tremaine Group last semester and rebranded this semester), don’t know too much about their specifics but they seem to have really good professional placements, but they did go underground for a bit because of hazing.   
UFA - This club is more focused on finance afaik, but from all I’ve heard they have a top-notch reputation for finance and in terms of placement  
BAP - BAP one of the few business frats on campus that have not been forced to rebrand - heard good things about them overall but don’t know too much about the specifics  
Some other clubs worth looking into:  
NIB, BEACN and TBG are some other clubs worth looking into if you’re more into the social impact side of consulting  
Venture, UpSync, and DiversaTech are also consulting clubs that are more tech oriented instead of being more generalist, with Venture specializing more in startups  
Honestly though, none of these clubs are worth stressing that much about - best advice is probably just to go to some of the info sessions or sign up for some of the coffee chats to get a feel for the members and to see if you can envision yourself getting along and having a good time with the people in the club and going based on gut feel from there",22
"Big difference is that consulting clubs like Voyager will have you working on projects directly for top companies, which can give you a leg up in work experience, while business frats/groups like BAP center on their training/development programs. Voyager and BAP are full of bing chillers though, highly recommend.",9
"Im an alum now, but here’s some advice that I wish I had followed: 
1) First, decide how badly you want to join these types of organizations. I mean really do a good introspective look.
2) If you dont get in first time, try again.

I tried once and it didnt go well. Then I never tried again. Looking back, I realized how fun some of these clubs looked and now regret it. Good luck kid",6
"As a graduating senior going into my full-time PM role soon, I'd like to say that I understand Berkeley Business pretty well. I'd like to start off by saying that all of these orgs are solid choices, and that they are all worth joining if you get in. However, there are major differences that I will break down:

  
BC -- BC is the oldest and most established, however of the consulting clubs, it is the most intense and requires the most time commitment. Think 20-25 hour weeks consistently for your first semester. They have a lot of quants, swe people and source excellent projects, but it is definitely a more competitive and intense environment.

  
CBA -- Simply put, best professional development on campus. They have the most McKinsey, Bain, and BCG placements of any campus org, and place nearly everyone they take into top IB groups. That being said, they are not a consulting club but often do consulting projects. However, they are not a consulting club, so if you are certain that you want a focus on serious consulting projects, you are better off joining Voyager, BC, BBS, etc. Believe they are founded by some old AKPsi members.

  
Voyager – Like a slightly less professional and more social version of BC. They still recruit very well, however, they are less intense and require a slightly lower time commitment. Think 15 hour weeks or less. Their job placement is good as well, so can't really go wrong with them.

  
BAP -- A fraternal Greek version of CBA, that recruits well into finance but less so into consulting. They are the only real business fraternity on campus, so they do have that greek pledging aspect that is very intense. However, the pledging does bring the org close together! You go to BAP if you want the Greek pledging experience, whereas you go to CBA if you want the professional placements in a more traditional but social environment.

  
UFA/UMCG -- basically a network for consultants and bankers. Solely professional development, so a great way to make connections with a low time commitment. Would not rely on it as a primary org, but if you get in, undoubtedly worth joining. 

Good luck and you'll be fine wherever you get in!",7
"As a first-year at Cal, I’ve taken the liberty to go around and see past general campus sentiment and into some of the real aspects of these clubs, and what you’ll gain, besides the name. If you’re looking for community, professional resources, and connections helpful for recruiting, you cannot go wrong with CBA or BAP. Obviously, consulting clubs like BBS, Voyager and BC may more to offer in terms of consulting projects themselves, but both CBA and BAP are filled with people from the best consulting/finance clubs all around campus (NIB, CMG, BBS, BC, UFA, etc) including people with leadership positions there. Banking/consulting recruiting, as I think someone else in this thread mentioned, is also unparalleled from groups such as CBA/BAP, because clubs centered on consulting projects don’t put as much stress on recruiting, and more so towards doing the projects themselves. BAP, however is the only “Greek” business org on campus tho, so if you’re looking for a traditional pledging experience you might enjoy your time there. CBA seems to have more focus on professional development, though, as they have less of a Greek identity, despite their high membership base of ex-AKPsi members. Anyhow, dont forget that you can always join more than one org though throughout undergrad, so don’t stress to much about making a single pick right now as I did during my first semester.",4

Y’all get interviews for these consulting clubs 🥲,1
"Super solid question, honestly; I had the same concerns when I was looking around too. Personally I chose [Venture](https://www.berkeleyvss.com/), for two main reasons: 

1) everyone I talked to were homies and were good people and not just in it for the professional stuff, but also were super down to help you with resume or recruiting, or just learning business things (rather than expecting you to come in with that sort of background). The new member training atmosphere was really about helping you from whatever starting point you were at and bringing you up from there, whether you're a super poppin eecs boi, pre-haas, or literally anything else with a diff degree of exp.  


2) I think the type of work that we do also lends itself to a more non-toxic environment. Because we work only with startups rather than chonky companies, you trade the name recognition for work with higher level management that can be super fulfilling. Compared to other clubs, I've noticed that people aren't as toxic or unwelcoming as elsewhere because they tend to have a different mindset, and aren't driven just by having a super clout company name on their resume or something.  


I've been with Venture for two years at this point and it's really helped me, so feel free to DM me with other questions or check out this other [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ib2wuw/businessconsulting_clubs_advice_pls/g1wd335/?context=3) from an older reddit post that may help :)",0
Any class that pads your GPA.,5
"For general consulting yeah there's no one-stop shop just bc of how varied the profession can be, otherwise theyd only hire Haas. That being said, in my experience, there's some classes that focus on specific skills that could help [im not familiar with Econ tho]

- classes with a major group project, esp if it's with an actual company: IEOR 115 (database), IEOR 135 (venturex)


- classes teaching hard skills that could always help to have familiarity with (excel, databases, pandas): UGBA 104/147 (excel), IEOR 115 (basic SQL, databases), D100 (SQL, pandas, technical projects)


- *less important, but good skills to have if you want to be more technical than the general rando*: IEOR 142/D144 (data analytics, basic ML, python, statsmodels), D101 (data eng, balance btwn IEOR 115 and CS 186), INFO 159 (NLP, but good overview of common neural networks to have familiarity)",2
"The three consulting clubs known for being the most prestigious and selective are BC, TBG, and NIB because they are the 3 oldest consulting clubs on campus. This also means that these 3 consulting clubs have the largest alumni network, institutional knowledge, and general clout and brand awareness.

Here’s a break down of the Big 3 (they call themselves TriCon): 
1.	⁠BC - BC is hands down most prestigious and take on the biggest name clients and are paid $$$ for their work. That being said it’s common for people to put in up to 20+ hours on consulting work for BC. But this also does mean you get really close with your team and the rest of the club. Some of the members are pretty fun, but most are very academic and scholarly. This also means though that they have a few superstars & their job placement at MBB and big banks is always good. TLDR: Can be a lot of work and some play, but best for professional development and clout.
2.	⁠TBG - TBG is the second oldest consulting club on campus and works exclusively with nonprofits. Their whole thing is that members are passionate about the social sector. Overall though, TBG folks are generally pretty chill & fun. Do know that they don’t work with huge name clients. However, TBG claims that working with nonprofits helps set you apart to job recruiters and on your Haas app. Take that as you will. But TBG does have a pretty consistent MBB/Banking/tech pipeline and a lot of Haas folks. TLDR: Smart, down to earth folks who have fun & have solid professional development. 
3.	⁠NIB - NIB is known for being the more casual and chill younger sibling of TBG and BC. They do a range of projects from  nonprofits, for-profits, and socially responsible businesses. They’re known to be the nicest and least buttoned up of the three consulting clubs. Also place pretty well professionally and are just generally well-rounded people. They won’t be the most brilliant people you meet at Berkeley, but they’re nice and fun to be around. TLDR: Wholesome & nice, wide range of projects. Also decent professional development.

Other consulting clubs that are awesome if you have a specific niche are Phoenix (Healthcare), Venture/Valley (Tech), BEACN (Environment) or imagiCal (Marketing). I would highly recommend these clubs if you know there is a specific niche you are interested in because BC, TBG, and NIB source different projects every semester so you’re not guaranteed something in your niche.

Consulting clubs I would absolutely avoid are BBS and CYC. They’re basically knock off versions of BC, TBG, and NIB, but they have 10x the ego and there are also a lot of rumors of foul play & drama. They’ll draw you in with the fancy events & brand name sponsors, but these people are peak Haas-holes.

At the end of the day, all consulting clubs are pretty pretentious, and you will succeed with or without them because you’re already at Berkelely. Obviously take all advice (including mine) with a grain of salt, and just try to meet as many people as possible. Trust your gut, and you will find your place. Go bears!",20
"pro-bono: tbg

tech: valley

startups: venture

oldest/alumni network: bc

social impact: nib",9
"If you’re dead set on applying to these pre-professional clubs, apply to them as you would colleges—a few newer ones, a couple well established ones, a couple highly selective ones

Fundamentally they’re all the same",4
"I’m pretty sure the three oldest and most prestigious are Berkeley Consulting, Net Impact, and th Berkeley Group. Each one is pretty difficult to get into. Best of luck!",4
biased but I would definitely recommend DiversaTech if you’re interested in tech or design in addition to business consulting. come chat with us on sproul next week!,5
"TBG, BC, NIB are top three on campus, personally i've heard the best things about TBG.. i went to an infosession last semester and the members were super cool and genuinely passionate about their work",4
"some good ones would be berkeley consulting, net impact, the berkeley group, voyager, cmg, and aba",4
"Speaking as someone in Haas and the business community but not in any clubs related to consulting, the best *management* consulting clubs (i.e. not design or something like that) are the ones [**sponsored by Haas**](https://berkeleyhbsa.org/hso):

1. Berkeley Consulting
2. The Berkeley Group (pro-bono; nonprofit)
3. BEACN (focus on sustainability for private, social, public sector)

The requirements for sponsorship at Haas are very stringent and BC and BEACN make a lot of money per project. TBG is pro-bono and does not, but still amazing. Lots of non-Haas clubs have sought its sponsorship but have been rejected, and some don't want the sponsorship anyways. That being said, there are two non-Haas sponsored clubs that are as prestigious as the Haas ones:

1. Vally Consulting Group (best one for consulting w/ tech)
2. Voyager Consulting (unsure of their focus)

Its important to recognize that consulting clubs matter moreso for fit and emphasis than just prestige. My friends in BEACN and VCG really only like it because of the atmosphere of the club and the perks of having so much funds (many consulting clubs charge dues and cost money, which I would avoid). If you're an asian dude thats potentially pre-med you'll love Phoenix, despite it not being as prestigious. If you're interested in tech but don't like the atmosphere of Valley Consulting, there's DiversaTech. If you're interested in pro-bono consulting for nonprofits but don't like TBG's vibe there's 180 Degrees, etc.",21
"BC is usually seen as the one with the most internal (Berkeley) prestige, and they do work with great corporate clients.

BBS and Voyager are also older and more established, both working with mostly big companies. 

Net Impact and TBG are seen as good social sector ones, both also older.

And then there are the industry-specific ones for people who really know what they want to do (Phoenix for healthcare, BEACN for conservation, VCG for tech all stand out).

I'm not in any of these but I am in a business club that overlaps with a lot of the consulting clubs & business frats, feel free to PM me if you're interested in learning more. I would advise paying less attention to perceived ""prestige"" and go look at all their websites for yourself!",12
"Speaking as someone in a consulting club, the best ones are the ones that:

1. Have a culture that you personally really like.
2. Have an emphasis or mission that you personally really like.
3. Are somewhat older / have a healthy presence on campus.
4. Are due-free (some charge dues) and are as diverse as possible.

The ones that I think have like, blanket-level prestige on campus are the three Haas-sponsored ones (I'm in one though so I do have bias), and Valley Consulting (tech-oriented) and Voyager (older and great projects). I'm definitely forgetting some more but in my opinion they're all great in so much as you personally like the club and its people!",10
"BC, VCG, Voyager, BEACN, TBG",6
"how's the workload at second-tier consulting clubs, like diversatech for example?",2
"It depends on the niche your interested in - if you like startups/entrepreneurship tho E@B is pretty good (entrepreneurs@berkeley) bc they really focused on creating a good environment. Overall though most of these clubs are the same, just find a club with authentic people that you feel comfortable with, and find a niche that interests you.",2
"Berkeley Consulting is arguably the most prestigious on campus, they work directly with fortune 100 companies and have the most ""clout"" (for lack of a better term). Extremely selective as well, as in, they accept like 10 kids a semester out of 300-500 applications.  

After that probably Voyager consulting, from talking a lot of  my Haas friends it seems to be the general consensus that they're the second most prestigious on campus.  

I've also heard a lot of great things about specific industry oriented consulting clubs, like Valley Consulting (which primarily works with tech companies and draws a lot of CS/EECS people) and Phoenix consulting (primarily works with biomedical/biotech firms, and draws a lot of pre-meds).",7
I’m not in it but went to their info sessions and met some ppl. They seem nice and do cool projects,1

Can students not attending cal but another uc join?,0
What type of consulting are you registered for under the  ASUC? Startup? I feel Ike someone already does that,1
"Voyager has some pretty awesome technical work. Stuff I got to do in the last year: economic modeling for illicit goods, learning clustering/classification techniques for huge customer datasets, build a backend and frontend for custom pricing software. Really good rewarding work to decking ratio.",9
"Apply to diversatech! Every semester we have projects that are both business- and technical-focused, and our community and socials are super fun. Our application + coffee chats are open @ https://www.diversatech.org/apply",6
"Personally I'm in venture and would say that esp as of late wqe do have a good mix of business and technical projects if you wanted to go that route (although not a requirement if you wanted to diversify your skillset). Working with startups means that we have a lot of flexibility with the types of projects that we can take on compared to if we were working with a massive company, so we're able to tailor our work to what the specific members on the project want to learn. If you're on a project and would want to do some optimization of delivery routes for a food delivery company, or some data analysis to understand customer pain points, you'd be able to talk with your PM to set that up. It's def going to be less technical than a pure 'core tech' club, but i'd argue that the flexibility of mixing tech and business however you want could be something to consider when looking around. I've written a few comments abt venture over the years so check my post history or DM me with questions :)",3
Imo a lot of the more embedded systems-y clubs have way cooler and fun projects if you’re interested at all on that side of things.,2
It sounds like you’re an upperclassman since you did a  lot of internships. Most of these major consulting clubs bring in lowerclassmen because they want them to grow and become the next leaders of their clubs.,21
"To all the concerned underclassmen reading, I'm pretty sure this is satire. Google APM Intern applications don't even open until Sept 8th. Def don't need 4/5 FAANG internships just to get an interview for a consulting club lol.",18
"You don’t need consulting clubs like these tbh. It seems like you are already and amazing student/worker by your experiences and not getting an interview def doesn’t speak to you or your work ethic in any sense. If your goal was to meet people, look into other clubs that are more open to others and less competitive (I’ve heard some people want to leave consulting clubs after their first semester due to burnout and whatnot too)",6
"Off topic, but any tips for someone looking to get my first CS internship this summer",1
"Many clubs do not take upperclassmen (even junior transfers) because they are looking for sustained, long-term commitment in their club. Because of this, you were probably rejected on a semi-auto drop basis",1
Yo what's consulting?,1
I saw Tamid Group is still consulting. Their deadline is Feb 9th i think,1

I’m interested! Dm me if you are still looking!,1
What a weird problem.,52
Lol just shitpost and tell everybody bullshit and then proceed to get promoted to president,34
"Not worth it tbh. I was in a consulting club my freshman year that wasn’t in my major and by the second semester I left. The sheer amount of work for what’s already very minimal gain is hard enough to justify on its own. I’d take that extra time you get to put into classes, research/internships/ and socializing vs joining a cult that doesn’t benefit you individually.",18
"if you have the hours for it might as well try it out for a semester and see if you vibe with the people there, but I’d put it at bottom priority if it looks like there’s other things competing for your time",2
"The whole point of a club (and college experience in general I guess) is to figure out what you like and don't like. If you think consulting is a possible career path, then go for it. Surely there must be reason that you applied in the first place.",2
Focus on gaining some experience outside of school bro. Fuck them clubs.,14
Any company that hires based on being in one of these clubs will have a work place at least as toxic as you would think,26
"Buck up.  You'd be far better off getting a real part time (summer?) job, any job will do.",6
“They need you more than you need them”,3
Me too it kinda hurt,2

"Hey there, just went through the other side of this - read and interviewed a ton of applicants last weekend so happy to share insights as well.",2
Hi! I went through all the interview rounds but I got rejected at the social round. Doesn't really make sense to me. Any insights?,1
Start your own if you really want to be one of these toxic clubs. There are no shortage of consulting rejects eager to pounce on any modicum of prestige and appearances to climb the social ladder,1
"Tailor it to the club as much as possible. We can tell when you submitted one that was also written for another club. Proofread and be sure you did not write another club's name. If you do, it's an auto-rejection.",1
